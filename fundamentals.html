                <h4><a id="semantics">Semantic HTML</a></h4>
                <p>Semantics refers to the meaning of something. When using HTML one should think about the information within the template and the organization of that information rather than its appearance. Once the data is organized it can later be styled using CSS for presentation purposes. The semantics of a webpage are important to programmatically traverse the data. Web browsers use this data and so do other agents such as smart phones and other programs. HTML is the data structure for the webpage which is separate from the graphical aspects we interact with as users.</p>
                <p>Along with the idea of separation between data and presentation is that HTML elements need to be used to represent the data appropriately. This is to help ensure that web browsers and other agents navigate and access the HTML correctly. For example if an agent wanted to display the title of the page it would look within the HEAD element for a child TITLE tag. This consistence is something we need to be able to rely upon and is why it is also so important to remember.</p>

                <h4><a id="seo">Search Engine Optimization</a></h4>
                <p>Optimizing a webpage to increase its search index on search engines, such as Google and Bing, is important in grabbing a consumer's eye. Not often is it that someone reviews several pages of search result to find what they're looking for. Algorithms are very good at locating what it is exactly that person is looking for and it usually appears toward the top of the results. Plus there are more widgets now which provide greater functionality to the user upfront (such as when searching for airline tickets for example) users don't have to look very far to find what they need.</p>
                <p>In order to be relevant a webpage must take into consideration "SEO" techniques to increase their chances of being ranked higher and found. This includes using the correct HTML elements and attributes (such as title and alt), having relevant words and content, as well as how many other webpages link back to yours which is important as a search engine's "crawler" investigates websites and links across the internet.</p>
                <p>If a website has the same content in more than one location it will help to use the rel=canonical attribute so search engines can redirect users to the page you would rather them see. This helps search engines organize the ranks appropriately and increases the SEO. Another technique similar to this is a 301 redirect. 301 is the status code for content that has moved permanently to another URL. Other codes include 302 which is either for "moved" or "found" content. In HTTP version 1.0 it meant "moved temporarily" but in version 1.1 it's been updated to mean "found". 307 became the replacement for "moved temporarily" in version 1.1. Meta Refresh is another redirect which is generally used with countdown times and "click here" links if the redirect doesn't occur. However it's not recommended for SEO and is slower.</p>
                <p>Link equity is another ranking factor which refers to links passing "value and authority" from one page to another. If a very valuable site links to another site then the search engine can presume the content on the linked site is valuable as well. Links need to be relevant to the original content, crawlable (via the robots.txt file), located in prominent places (e.g. within the main content as opposed to a footer), and use the appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g. 200 and 301). These factors play into a links value and equity.</p>
                <p>The robots.txt file is the first file a crawler will parse once it reaches a website. This file can tell the crawler which pages to skip which can be important so internal pages (those of which a user interacts with once logged into the site) are not crawled and indexed. Google has even commented that internal search results pages are considered spam so these should be excluded in this way.</p>
                <p>Schema Markup is another aspect of SEO. It's a "semantic vocabulary of tags (or microdata) that you can add to your HTML to improve the way search engines read and represent your pages" in search results according to Moz.com. Moz.com continues by describing the differences between Schema, microdata, and structured data:</p>
                <p><ul><li>Structured data is a system of pairing a name with a value that helps search engines categorize and index your content. Microdata is one form of structured data that works with HTML5. Schema.org is a project that provides a particular set of agreed-upon definitions for microdata tags.</li></ul></p>
                <p>Schema can be used to enhance the search results descriptions with content such as reviews, organizational information, and information about a person or book for example. The major search engines use this data to enhance the results page but it's unclear if using the markup actually helps with search ranking but appears to increase the website's click-through rate as users are more apt to click a link with a more descriptive result.</p>
                <p>HTML defines the semantics of a webpage, and Schema helps to give context to the data. For example a header tag with the text "avatar" may refer to a movie, an image, or some other content. Using Schema helps better define the content which helps search engines determine how to display the data in search results.</p>
                <p>The official Schema.org documentation explains that "microdata is a set of tags introduced in HTML5" which allow us to markup HTML with this additional data.</p>
                <h5>Schema Example</h5>
                <p>Some of the important tags to remember are: itemscope, itemtype, and itemprop. These can be added to HTML elements to signify different things. itemscope should be applied to the wrapping HTML element for a given group of information. The itemtype is used to describe what that group of information is, for example a movie. itemprop is used to more fully define other information about the item, for example an author's name and a genre. Below is a concrete example of apply Schema to a div describing a book.</p>
                <pre>
&lt;div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Book">
    &lt;h1 itemprop="name">Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software&lt;/h1>
    &lt;span>Written by:&lt;span itemprop="author">Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, John Vlissides&lt;/span>&lt;/span>
    &lt;span itemprop="genre">Software Engineering&lt;/span>
&lt;/div>
                </pre>
                <p>The most generic type is "thing" which has the following properties:</p>
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Name</th>
                        <th>Type</th>

                <h4><a id="accessibility">Screen Readers</a></h4>
                <p>Using semantic HTML is very important when considering accessibility and screen readers. The browser and accessibility tools will key off of the semantic HTML to help someone navigate your website. Using the wrong element to accomplish something, such as using a div element to create a button, can be confusing to people and other agents.</p>
                <p>Using the correct ARIA and semantic HTML is also helpful in navigating a page because users can quickly navigate between links, forms, headings, paragraphs, sections and other elements. Along with that being descriptive within an opening sentence in a new paragraph for instance helps users skip content they aren't interested in much like someone would who can visually review the content.</p>
                <p>Screen readers convert text to speech to help people navigate and understand a website. These users may have disabilities ranging from visual impairment to cognitive disabilities. Being sure to define the language the website is presented in is very important. This can be done within the html tag by defining a lang attribute. It's also possible to wrap smaller sections of text in the span element and apply the lang attribute to the span (though lang can be applied to many other elements as well).</p>
                <p>The proper use of headings is helpful as well because search engines use these to index a webpage's structure and content. People are drawn to the headlines which direct them to different sections of relevant content.</p>
                <p>Alternative text is important to have on images. This helps give context to the page when a screen reader encounters an image. Screen readers will read the text in the alt attribute for the user so be sure the text is descriptive. It's also useful to users when an image link is broken because the alt text will display for them.</p>
                <p>Finally it is important that links are spelled out and descriptive to the user. "Click here" means nothing but links such as "book airline tickets here" helps to put things into perspective. Remember we can add title attributes to elements such as the anchor tag. Doing so is helpful because the information can be displayed as a tooltip to the user when mousing over the link.</p>
                <p>It's important to remember that content described through a screen reader is much line an automated telephone directory. The content is "linearized" to the listener so, while some users can quickly navigate a webpage visually, those users who utilize a screen reader must do so by listening to each option before understanding what actions are available. Consider this when designing your webpages.</p>

                <h4><a id="layout">Layout Container</a></h4>
                <p>Utilizing a layout for your website is important to help guide users to your content. Often content is displayed similarly to how magazines and newspapers layout their content. There are main headings and footers for consistency and navigation. Important information is placed between these sections in relevant ways. It's also important that navigation is easy between different sections of your website. Several new HTML5 elements help with creating layouts. These are: header, nav, section, article, aside, and footer.</p>
