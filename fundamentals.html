                            Semantics refers to the meaning of something. When using HTML one should think about the information within the template and the organization of that information rather than 
                            its appearance. Once the data is organized it can later be styled using CSS for presentation purposes. The semantics of a web page are important to aid in programmatically traversing the 
                            data. Web browsers use this data and so do other agents such as smart phones and web crawlers for instance. HTML is the data structure for the web page and is separate from the graphical 
                            aspects we interact with as users.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Along with the idea of the separation between data and presentation is that HTML elements also need to be used to represent the data appropriately. This is to help ensure that web 
                            browsers and other agents (like screen readers) navigate and access the HTML correctly. For example if an agent wanted to display the title of the page it would look within the HEAD element for a 
                            child TITLE tag. This consistency is something we need to be able to rely upon and is why it is also so important to remember.

                            Optimizing a web page to increase its search index on search engines, such as Google and Bing, is important in grabbing a consumer's eye. Not often is it that someone reviews 
                            several pages of search result to find what they're looking for. Algorithms are very good at locating what it is exactly that that person is looking for and it usually appears toward 
                            the top of the results. Plus there are more widgets now which provide greater functionality to the user upfront (such as when searching for airline tickets for example) users 
                            don't have to look very far to find what they need.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In order to be relevant a web page must take into consideration "SEO" techniques to increase their chances of being ranked higher and found. This includes using the correct HTML 
                            elements and attributes (such as title and alt), having relevant words and content, as well as how many other web pages link back to it which is important as a search engine's 
                            "crawler" investigates websites and links across the internet.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If a website has the same content in more than one location it will help to use the rel=canonical attribute so search engines can redirect users to the page you would rather them 
                            see. This helps search engines organize the ranks appropriately and increases the SEO. Another technique similar to this is a 301 redirect. 301 is the status code for content that 
                            has moved permanently to another URL. Other codes include 302 which is either for "moved" or "found" content. In HTTP version 1.0 it meant "moved temporarily" but in version 1.1 it's 
                            been updated to mean "found". 307 became the replacement for "moved temporarily" in version 1.1. Meta Refresh is another redirect which is generally used with countdown timers and 
                            "click here" links if the redirect doesn't occur. However it's not recommended for SEO and is slower.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Link equity is another ranking factor which refers to links passing "value and authority" from one page to another. If a very valuable site links to another site then the search 
                            engine can presume the content on the linked site is valuable as well. Links need to be relevant to the original content, crawlable (via the robots.txt file), located in prominent 
                            places (e.g. within the main content as opposed to a footer), and use the appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g. 200 and 301). These factors play into a links value and equity.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The robots.txt file is the first file a crawler will parse once it reaches a website. This file can tell the crawler which pages to skip which can be important so internal pages 
                            (those of which a user interacts with once logged into the site) are not crawled and indexed. Google has even commented that internal search results pages are considered spam so these 
                            should be excluded in this way.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Schema Markup is another aspect of SEO. It's a "semantic vocabulary of tags (or microdata) that you can add to your HTML to improve the way search engines read and represent your 
                            pages" in search results according to Moz.com. Moz.com continues by describing the differences between Schema, microdata, and structured data:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Structured data is a system of pairing a name with a value that helps search engines categorize and index your content. Microdata is one form of structured data that works 
                                with HTML5. Schema.org is a project that provides a particular set of agreed-upon definitions for microdata tags.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Schema can be used to enhance the search results descriptions with content such as reviews, organizational information, and information about a person or book for example. 
                            The major search engines use this data to enhance the results page but it's unclear if using the markup actually helps with search ranking but appears to increase the website's 
                            click-through rate as users are more apt to click a link with a more descriptive result.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            HTML defines the semantics of a web page, and Schema helps to give context to the data. For example a header tag with the text "avatar" may refer to a movie, an image, or some 
                            other content. Using Schema helps better define the content which helps search engines determine how to display the data in search results.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The official Schema.org documentation explains that "microdata is a set of tags introduced in HTML5" which allow us to markup HTML with this additional data.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Schema Example</h5>
                        <p>
                            Some of the important tags to remember are: itemscope, itemtype, and itemprop. These can be added to HTML elements to signify different things. itemscope should be applied to 
                            the wrapping HTML element for a given group of information. The itemtype is used to describe what that group of information is, for example a movie. itemprop is used to more 
                            fully define other information about the item, for example an author's name and a genre. Below is a concrete example of apply Schema to a div describing a book.
                        </p>
                        <pre>
        &lt;div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Book">
            &lt;h1 itemprop="name">Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software&lt;/h1>
            &lt;span>Written by:&lt;span itemprop="author">Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, John Vlissides&lt;/span>&lt;/span>
            &lt;span itemprop="genre">Software Engineering&lt;/span>
        &lt;/div>
                        </pre>
                        <p>The most generic type is "thing" which has the following properties:</p>
                        <table>

                            Using semantic HTML is very important when considering accessibility and screen readers. The browser and accessibility tools will key off of the semantic HTML to help someone 
                            navigate your website. Using the wrong element to accomplish something, such as using a div element to create a button, can be confusing to people and other agents (like screen
                            readers or programs parsing a website).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Using the correct ARIA and semantic HTML is also helpful in navigating a page because users can quickly navigate between links, forms, headings, paragraphs, sections and other 
                            elements. Along with that being descriptive within an opening sentence in a new paragraph for instance helps users skip content they aren't interested in much like someone could 
                            who can visually review the content.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Screen readers convert text to speech to help people navigate and understand a website. These users may have disabilities ranging from visual impairment to cognitive disabilities. 
                            Being sure to define the language the website is presented in is very important. This can be done within the html tag by defining a lang attribute. It's also possible to wrap smaller 
                            sections of text in the span element and apply the lang attribute to the span (although lang can be applied to many other elements as well).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The proper use of headings is helpful too because search engines use these to index a web page's structure and content. People are drawn to the headlines which direct them to 
                            different sections of relevant content.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Alternative text is important to have on images. This helps give context to the image when a screen reader encounters one. Screen readers will read the text in the alt attribute 
                            to the user so be sure the text is descriptive. It's also useful for users when an image link is broken because the alt text will display for them on the page. This provides some 
                            context when the path to the image is broken.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Finally it is important that links are spelled out and descriptive to the user. "Click here" means nothing but links such as "book airline tickets here" help to put things into 
                            perspective. Remember we can add title attributes to elements such as the anchor tag. Doing so is helpful because the information can be displayed as a tooltip to the user when 
                            mousing over the link.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It's important to remember that content described through a screen reader is much like an automated telephone directory. The content is "linearized" to the listener so, while some 
                            users can quickly navigate a web page visually, those users who utilize a screen reader must do so by listening to each option before understanding what actions are available. 
                            Consider this when designing your web pages.

                        <p>
                            Utilizing a layout for your website is important to help guide users around your site. Often content is displayed similarly to how magazines and newspapers layout their content. 
                            There are main headings and footers for consistency and navigation. Important information is placed between these sections in relevant ways. It's also important that navigation is 
                            easy between different sections of your website. Several new HTML5 elements help with creating layouts. These are: header, nav, section, article, aside, details, summary, and footer.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There are several different techniques for creating a layout. These range from basic tables, floats, a flexbox, modern frameworks, and grid views. Tables are generally not 
                            recommended because they weren't even designed to be a layout tool [1]. Other options provide more modern and flexible alternatives, which are important when considering mobile 
                            devices and varying screen size and resolution.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This page itself uses several of the aforementioned elements including section, article, and nav. Each topic on this page is defined as an article. These are wrapped 
                            in a section element for a given area of focus (i.e. HTML, CSS or JS). I'm also using a nav element for navigation to the right of the content in the scrolling sidebar. 
                            I'm also using a nav element for quick navigation to topics within a particular section in the content introductions.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Frameworks</h5>
                        <p>
                            There are several popular CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap and Foundation. These frameworks supply their own set of HTML and CSS element for you to use in consistent and reliable 
                            ways. Both of the aforementioned frameworks are modern and mobile friendly and take out a lot of the work in setting up device agnostic websites.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Floats</h5>
                        <p>
                            The float property can help build layouts as well and it's quite possible you will run across this property when dealing with styling at some point or another. It can be confusing 
                            so spending some time reviewing it could be helpful. Ultimately the property "floats" the content of an element to the left or right and is commonly used to wrap text around images [2].
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The clear property specifies what elements can float beside the cleared element and on which side [2]. It has several properties: none, left, right, both, and inherit. You generally 
                            want to clear the same direction as the content is being floated. If you float content to the right, then you should clear the content to the right. This would mean that no floating 
                            elements are allowed on the right side of the element [2]. Sometimes content is too large for an element so a clearfix must be applied. If there is any overflow the containing element will 
                            expand to enclose the large content. The code samples below are examples of two ways to create a clearfix as described by W3 Schools [2].
                        </p>
                        <pre>
        .clearfix {
            overflow: auto;
        }

        .clearfix::after {
            content: "";
            clear: both;
            display: table;
        }
                        </pre>
                        <h5>Flexbox</h5>
                        <p>
                            The CSS Flexbox is a new layout mode available in CSS3. It's only supported in more modern browsers with no support in IE10 and earlier [1]. The flexbox helps ensure that elements 
                            "behave predictably when the page layout must accommodate different screen sizes and different display devices" [1]. The flexbox allows content within a container to "flex" into a 
                            dynamic size. The container is able to alter the height and width of its items to fill the available space [3]. It is also direction-agnostic where block is vertically-based and inline 
                            is horizontally-based [3].
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The flexbox has several parts because it encompasses the whole widget rather than a single item. There is the parent container known as the "flex container" and the elements within 
                            that container known as "flex items" [3]. The following examples color the containing element brown and the child items as light-yellow and each apply characteristics of the flexbox 
                            differently.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Flex Container Row. This wraps and is justified to the end.</h5>
                        <div class="flex-container-row flex-container">
                            <div class="flex-item">

                            All of the above examples use CSS properties of the container element. The following uses properties of the items themselves. It's possible to change the order of the items by defining 
                            an ordering index using the order property. You can see an example of this in the next sample.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Flex Item Order. Order was used to arrange these items.</h5>

                            <div class="flex-order-item-second flex-item">
                                This is defined last, but is ordered second.
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            flex-grow and flex-shrink are used to expand or reduce the size of an item if necessary. These are proportional numbers so if an item has a flex-grow value of 2 and the other items 
                            have 1 the item set to 2 would take up about half the size of the container [3].

                            flex-basis is used to "set the default size of an element before the remaining space is distributed" [3]. flex is a combination of flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis. 
                            CSS-Tricks.com recommends using this shorthand version because it knows how to intelligently set the properties. The default is 0 1 auto [3].

                            Finally it's possible for items to align themselves. The align-self property allows an element to be aligned using the same values as the container align-items property 
                            (e.g. flex-start, flex-end, stretch, and center).

                        <h5>Grid</h5>
                        <p>
                            The CSS Grid allows a designer to organize content is a grid-based layout using rows and columns. Frameworks such as Bootstrap and Foundation have their own implementations which 
                            help make modern web pages responsive. Generally a grid is broken into twelve columns and CSS styles are generated to size content based on those columns. For example one could define 
                            CSS classes for content which may span between one and all twelve columns. Each of these would be given a width proportionate to its size. This can be taken further to add style based 
                            on small, medium, and large screen sizes (which you will find the mentioned frameworks support).

                            Understanding the Document Object Model is important when building a website. Modern frameworks like Angular and React manipulate the DOM for you to make creating user interfaces easier. 
                            These frameworks at least abstract away the lower level details for you. The DOM (as it's known) is what connects web pages to scripts and programming languages [1]. "The DOM represents 
                            a document with a logical tree" [1]. This tree can be traversed and updated using JavaScript and libraries such as jQuery as well as with the DOM interface.

                        <p>
                            In the following sections we'll explore manipulating the DOM and adding or modifying HTML. We'll also see use of different media controls and learn more about the HTML5 Canvas as well as Scaled Vector Graphics (SVGs).

                            Understanding the fundamentals of manipulating the DOM is important. It's what modern frameworks and libraries are built upon. Aidan Ryan has a good overview of this particular section of the exam on his blog. 
                            To quote him, "the document object is a node that represents the entire HTML document (including the head). Everything in the DOM is a node. It's important to differentiate between nodes and elements: all 
                            elements are nodes, but not all nodes are elements. For example, a div element may have an id attribute - the attribute is a node, but not an element" [2].

                        <div class="modify-dom-examples">
                            <div>
                                Here are some examples of the DOM API:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Grab a single element by ID: <pre>document.getElementById('elementId')</pre></li>
                                    <li>Gather a list of elements by the tag name: <pre>document.getElementsByTagName('div')</pre></li>
                                    <li>Gather an array of elements by name: <pre>document.getElementsByName('name')</pre></li>
                                    <li>Gather an array of elements by CSS class: <pre>document.getElementsByClassName('class')</pre></li>
                                </ul>
                            </div>

                                Here are the equivalent examples using jQuery:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Grab a single element by ID: <pre>$('#elementId')</pre></li>
                                    <li>Gather a list of elements by the tag name: <pre>$('div')</pre></li>
                                    <li>Gather an array of elements by name: <pre>$('[name="name"]')</pre></li>
                                    <li>Gather an array of elements by CSS class: <pre>$('.class') </pre></li>
                                </ul>

                            The Node class is "an interface from which a number of DOM API object types inherit" [3]. Those being: Document, Element, Attr, CharacterData (which Text, Comment, 
                            and CDATASection all inherit from), ProcessingInstruction, DocumentFragment, DocumentType, Notation, Entity, EntityReference [3]. Because these all inherit from the 
                            same Node interface they are able to be treated the same way.

                        <p>
                            Some of the notable properties include:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Node.nodeType: returns an unsigned short representing the type of the node (e.g. ELEMENT_NODE: 1, ATTRIBUTE_NODE: 2, TEXT_NODE: 3, ENTITY_NODE: 6, DOCUMENT_NODE: 9, DOCUMENT_TYPE_NODE: 10).</li>
                            <li>Node.nodeName: returns a DOMString containing the name of the Node. Differs depending on the node type. For example HTMLElement will contain the name of the corresponding tag, like 'audio', for an HTMLAudioElement, or Text will return a '#text' string.</li>
                            <li>Node.nodeValue: returns or sets the value of the current node.</li>
                            <li>Node.parentNode: returns a Node that is the parent of the current node. Returns null if no parent is available (e.g. if the parent is not an Element).</li>
                            <li>Node.previousSibling: returns a Node representing the previous node in the tree, null if there isn't a node available.</li>
                            <li>Node.nextSibling: returns a Node representing the next node in the tree, null if there isn't a node available.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            The jQuery equivalents to firstChild, lastChild, nextSibling, and previousSibling are below:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><pre>var element = $('#container');</pre></li>
                            <li><pre>element.children(':first');</pre></li>
                            <li><pre>element.children(':last')</pre></li>
                            <li><pre>element.next();</pre></li>
                            <li><pre>element.prev();;</pre></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Elements can have attributes which provide additional information about them. They are set like name="value" pairs within the starting tag. Some examples of attributes 
                            include: src, alt, title, rel, width, height, style, lang, id, class, for, name, onresize. There are many more and you can view a list on the W3 School.com website following 
                            this link: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_attributes.asp" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Goes to the attribute list on W3Schools.com">W3 School.com attribute list</a> [4].
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Attributes are not considered children of a node [2]. We can access them using the DOM API like so (there is no jQuery equivalent but you can build your own [5]):
                        </p>
    <pre>
        var div = document.getElementById('divId');
        var attributes = div.attributes;
    </pre>
                        <p>
                            Attributes can be updated, removed, and accessed using either jQuery or the DOM API as Aidan Ryan demonstrates on his blog [2]:
                        </p>
    <pre>
        var div = document.getElementById('divId');

        var jqVal = jqDiv.attr('id');
        jqdiv.attr('id', 'newValue');

                        Finally, as Aidan Ryan concludes on his blog, for both the DOM API and jQuery an element can only exist in one place in the DOM. So to move a node using these techniques
                        removes it from its old position and places it in the new one. jQuery provides the following methods which target a particular node and pass the new content as a parameter:
                        after, before, append, prepend, replaceWith, wrap, wrapInner, wrapAll. The following related methods in jQuery target the new content and pass the targeted selector in as 
                        a parameter: insertAfter, insertBefore, appendTo, prependTo, replaceAll. Lastly remove targets just the specific content to be removed from the DOM.

                        <p>
                            People consume a lot of media from the web and over the years there have been different advances allowing people to do just that. As MDN explains, in the early days of
                            the web video files were too large to be consumed given bandwidth and other technological limitations [3]. As the web grew extensions like Flash provided a way to consume
                            media and Flash quickly became popular. These extensions have had issues with security vulnerabilities among other things. Now with HTML5 and modern browsers we can utilize 
                            the video and audio tags to provide media playback natively within the browser. We can also utilize services like YouTube for the hosting and streaming of content.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Audio</h5>
                        <p>
                            Both the video and audio tag support the following attributes [1]:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>src: the URL for the audio or video content</li>
                            <li>autoplay: a boolean determining if the content should play automatically or not</li>
                            <li>loop: a boolean for replaying the content automatically or not</li>
                            <li>controls: a boolean telling the browser to show media controls for the content</li>
                            <li>preload: how much data should be preloaded before the content can begin (none, metadata only, or an automatic amount determined by the browser)</li>
                            <li>muted: a boolean specifying if the content should be muted or not</li>
                            <li>type: a string indicating the MIME (multipurpose internet mail extension) type for the content</li>
                            <li>crossorigin: an attribute to determine if the Origin header should be sent along with the request to gather the content or not</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            The audio element supports three audio file types: MP3, WAV, and OGG. You can provide multiple source files for the different file types as well as a fallback message if 
                            the user's browser doesn't support the audio tag (for example IE 8 and below). Here is an example of an audio element (Music: www.bensound.com):
                        </p>
                        <audio controls="controls" preload="auto">
                            <source src="https://www.bensound.org/bensound-music/bensound-summer.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
                            <p>Your browser does not support the audio element.</p>
                        </audio>
                        <h5>Video</h5>
                        <p>
                            The video tag supports the above attributes as well as a poster attribute. This would be a URL to an image to display while the video loads [1]. Several other attributes include:
                            buffered for adding time ranges for the buffered media and playsinline for playing the media back within the element's playback area (though not including this doesn't mean the 
                            content would default to full screen) [4]. Like the audio tag, the video tag also supports fallback content in the form of a paragraph. When providing fallback content you can 
                            explain to the user that the tag is not supported by their browser. You could also link them to the content on another site or provide more description of the content.
                        </p>
                        <video controls="controls" src="https://d2v9y0dukr6mq2.cloudfront.net/video/preview/hawaii-beautiful-scenic-roadway-aerial_-yrjn2-s__PM.mp4" type="video/mp4" preload="auto">
                            <p>Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is a <a href="https://videos.pexels.com/videos/woman-in-front-of-the-computer-857851" title="Goes to the video hosted on Pexels.com." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">link to the video</a> instead.</p>
                        </video>
                        <p>
                            The ability to provide fallback sources is important because different browsers may only support certain file types (which is true for older browser versions). As the years go by 
                            more and more standards are supported but providing fallbacks is always a good practice. Some attributes need to be supplied for different browsers to play the media correctly.
                            For example the MIME type must be provided for audio media to play correctly in Firefox.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There are a number of events that are related to media playback. These include [1][4]:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>canplay: The browser can play the media but possibly not through its entirety (canplaythrough estimates if the browser won't have to buffer the media).</li>
                            <li>playing: Playback is ready after being paused or stopped due to a lack of data.</li>
                            <li>ended: Playback has stopped because the end of the media has been reached.</li>
                            <li>timeupdate: The currentTime attribute has been updated.</li>
                            <li>play: Playback has started.</li>
                            <li>pause: Playback has paused.</li>
                            <li>volumechange: The volume of the media has changed.</li>

                        <h5>Graphics</h5>
                        <p>
                            Scalable Vector Graphics and the Canvas element are two different ways to add graphics and animation to a website. SVGs are scalable so the resolution doesn't degrade as an image 
                            changes its size. SVGs are great for icons that need to scale based on device size and screen resolution. The canvas is strictly programmable using JavaScript and is great for things 
                            like games and animations. Using the canvas you can draw shapes and animate them. You also have access to WebGL which is a powerful tool for creating 3D and 2D objects.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Each of these tools has pros and cons so use each depending on your need. Ben Sinca lists several key differences between the two. Canvas is resolution dependent, 
                            has no support for event handlers, has poor text rendering capabilities, can be saved as an image (png or jpg), and is well suited for graphical  games [3]. He writes that
                            SVGs are resolution independent, support event handlers, are best suited for apps with large rendering areas, slow rendering can be complex, and that they are not 
                            suited for games [3]. As Aidan Ryan describes in his blog post, canvas is more of a "fire and forget" or "immediate" model of rendering whereas SVGs have a 
                            "retained mode" which allows us to change and re-render the graphics [1].
                        </p>
                        <h5>Canvas</h5>
                        <p>
                            Canvas allows us to draw lines, rectangles, curves and other shapes. The origin is in the upper left with the x axis along the top and the y axis
                            being vertical. Positive values along the x axis move to the right, and for the y axis these move down the screen. In order to interact with the canvas you must
                            get the context in which you intend to draw with, for example 3D or 2D. This context is what you interact with and call methods on in order to draw and manipulate the canvas. 
                            The context has style attributes which can be set to change colors and gradients and methods for drawing lines and shapes like boxes and curves. 
                            Below is an example of a canvas with multiple different examples from text to shapes and lines.
                        </p>
                        <canvas id="example-canvas" class="example-canvas" width="400" height="200"></canvas>
                        <h5>Scalable Vector Graphics - SVGs</h5>
                        <p>
                            SVGs are great for graphics and icons when you need to consider resolution and screen sizes of multiple devices. Font Awesome is a website which provides a large set 
                            of vector icons that can be freely used on websites. They also have an SVG Framework that utilizes SVGs which is a great example of all of this in action. SVGs can be 
                            modified with CSS as well as their own attributes [1]. They can even be modified using the DOM API and pseudo-classes can trigger changes too [1]. Below is a 
                            simple example of an SVG using the Codewars.com logo. There are also a couple of examples of different shapes below that.

                            Updating your website's user interface programmatically as a user interacts with it is an important part of creating an engaging experience. Dynamic websites
                            can provide a much more rich experience for the user. It may be the difference in attracting and keeping people on your site for longer periods of time.
                            That can be important if you are building a website which intends to captivate an audience and engage them long-term. Updating the UI based on user selections,
                            or from reacting to different events, is certainly a nice touch but in the current day and age it is more or less expected.

                            The styling we'll focus on in this section will be on changing the location of an element, applying transforms, and showing and hiding elements. We can apply
                            these techniques to this page and help clean up the user experience and interface to make the page more accessible and easier to navigate. I did this 
                            by show and hiding each of the topics to reduce the initial amount of vertical scrolling.

                        <p>
                            The location of an element can be controlled by the CSS properties position, top, right, bottom, and left. The position property has six values which affect the location
                            of the element. These are static, relative, fixed, absolute, inherit and sticky [4]. Elements are static by default and are not affected by the top, right, bottom, or left properties [2].
                            The top, right, bottom, and left properties affect how a child element is placed in relation to its nearest positioned ancestor [3]. They also affect the element differently
                            depending on the position used.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The relative position allows us to use the right/left/top/bottom/z-index properties to move the targeted element in the specified direction. Absolute position allows as to manipulate an element
                            as if you could place it anywhere on the page. Fixed is very similar to absolute but it isn't affected by scrolling where absolute is (so fixed elements are always visible depending on their position. 
                            For example the side navigation of this page uses the fixed position). Sticky is still experimental and acts much like the relative position. However once the viewport reaches a set value the element 
                            will stay fixed in location. Inherit is used to force the position property to cascade down to the targeted children. The position property doesn't cascade by default. [4]
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Using left, right, bottom, and the other related properties on a relative positioned element adjusts the targeted element in those directions. If styling a child element they move in relation to their
                            parent as long as both elements have a position set. Otherwise the child may move in relation to the document and not its parent element. The example below styles the overall parent div as relative.
                            Then the inner div with multiple child divs is positioned absolutely in relation to the parent container.

                            One way to apply a transform to an element is to use CSS. CSS3 allows for lateral, rotational, scaling, and skewing transforms to be applied to elements. This can be done in both 2D and
                            3D [1]. The transform property can apply several functions including: scale, skewX, shewY, translate, rotate, matrix, perspective [2]. Multiple transforms can be applied to an element. 
                            For example: transform: translate(-50px, -30px) skewY(10deg) rotateX(45deg); applies a translation, skewY and rotateX to the targeted element. A space-separated list of transform allows
                            you to add multiple types as in the example. This is also the order in which they are applied [2].
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Scaling an element applies the scaling to font-size, padding, height, and width properties [2]. Translate moves the element on the x and/or y axis. 
                            Rotate unsurprisingly will rotate the element by a number of degrees (i.e. 10deg). Rotations can be applied on the x, y, or z axis.  Skewing the element can be done 
                            vertically or horizontally. There are x and y variants and a skew method which applies the skew in both directions given arguments for both x and y. 
                        </p>
                        <p> 
                            The matrix transform can be used to apply multiple transforms at once. There are tools which can help group your transforms into a single matrix. This can help reduce file 
                            size in some cases but is hard to read [2]. The matrix transform would mainly be used for games and mathematically intense graphical programs. There are also 3D variants 
                            for each of these properties which incorporate the z axis for manipulating elements in 3D space. This can be helpful in game development.

                        <p>
                            There are several ways to show and hide an element. That being manually writing the code yourself or using an existing method from a framework like jQuery [1][2].
                            Ultimately we want to change the display attribute of the element to none which will hide the element and its children. In my example on this page I'm using 
                            the jQuery .toggle method [1]. This method has many different parameters which can customize the show and hide logic, for example a duration parameter for the length
                            of time to show or hide the element. However it's easy enough to use to just toggle the display. This is good for information that you'd like to hide from the user
                            and to let them decide to view it (and vice versa) as a "show more" or less button for instance. This helps remove noise from the page and allows the user to focus 
                            on the content that they are interested in. I'm using it on this page to collapse the content of each article to help reduce the overall length of the page. By doing that 
                            it helps me navigate from section to section more quickly.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It's also possible to use the CSS property visibility to show and hide an element. This property can hide the element but doesn't actually remove the space it takes up
                            from the document (as opposed to display: none which hides everything and removes the element's space on the page). These properties can be accessed programmatically using 
                            the DOM API and jQuery as well. You can access these properties using the DOM API by accessing the .style of an element. jQuery has a hide() method which will hide the 
                            selected element. [3]

                            The Web Storage API and the Geolocation API are important HTML5 APIs to become familiar with. There are however many, many more than these two.
                            MDN has a great list of those available [3].
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Web Storage API allows for the storing of key/value pairs. This can be utilized in a more intuitive way than traditional cookies [1]. The storage API has 
                            two ways to store data. Either in session or local storage. The first persists data for the duration of the browsing session (until the browser is 
                            closed). The second stores data between sessions (when the browser is closed and reopened later) [1]. These can be useful if you want to track a small 
                            amount of data and not want to use a traditional database solution you provide yourself.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The geolocation API is popular because many applications react to a user's known location. Apps use location to display things on the screen, or alert users of
                            information. Consider an app like Google Maps for instance which can help you navigate from your current location to anywhere else in the world. Privacy is always
                            a concern so the user is asked for permission by the browser before the data can be gathered and used.

                            The Web Storage API extends the Window object and provides two properties. Those being the Window.sessionStorage and Window.localStorage. These properties
                            allow access to the session and local Storage objects for saving data. There is also a StorageEvent which fires when persisted data changes. [1]
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There are other storage options as well. For instance, Mozilla has mozStorage which interfaces with SQLite. There is also the Storage API which "defines a
                            common, shared standard to be used by all APIs and technologies that store content-accessible data for individual Web sites" [2].
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The standards around storage are still being developed. For instance, most browsers have private modes which aren't supposed to save data about your session and 
                            page viewing history. In some cases companies have opted to disable the use of storage features where others allow full control even in the private mode. Being aware
                            of this and how different vendors operate when implementing storage features is important to keep in mind. [1]
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            sessionStorage allows you to save up to 5MB which is more than a cookie and the data is never transferred to the sever. localStorage is similar to
                            sessionStorage but is not cleared when the browser closes (only with JS or when the history is cleared). The localStorage storage limit is the largest
                            among cookies, sessionStorage, and localStorage. [1]

                            The Geolocation interface represents an object that is able to obtain the position of a user's device [1]. This is important in applications 
                            that utilize a user's location for interactions or display (such as with a map application). The Navigator object implements the geolocation interface
                            and the location data can be obtained from the navigator.geolocation property [1].
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There are three methods to be aware of. Those are getCurrentPosition(), watchPosition(), and clearWatch(). The getCurrentPosition() method returns
                            the device's location by returning a Position object. Position objects have a coords and timestamp property of type Coordinates and DOMTimeStamp 
                            respectively. The Coordinates object has several properties including latitude, longitude, altitude, accuracy, heading, and speed [2].
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The watchPosition() method returns a long id value which represents the callback functions to be invoked whenever the device location
                            changes [1]. This method takes two callback functions as arguments. One for success and one for failure. The third argument is an optional 
                            PositionOptions object for configuring the location watch. The clearWatch() method removes the callback handler that was set with the 
                            watchPosition() method [1]. clearWatch() accepts an id argument.

                            JavaScript behaves differently than many other programming languages you may be use to. Because it is loosely and dynamically typed
                            variables can be assigned anything you wish and be reassigned to different types later on in your program. The scope at which your
                            variable is available is also important to keep in mind. The keywords var, let, and const operate differently when declaring a variable and 
                            open up your variables to different scopes. Along with that, the keyword this changes its value when the scope changes and so it can be
                            confusing when dealing with events.

                            var is the most common way to declare and initialize a variable. var declarations are processed before any code is executed in a process called
                            hoisting. var variables have a scope within their current execution context [1]. This scope is either globally (when declared outside of a function)
                            or within the scope of the enclosing function that declares it [1]. Re-declaring a var won't wipe its value [1]. Undeclared variables (those without 
                            the var keyword as one example) are globally scoped. Undeclared variables don't exist until the code that assigns to them is executed [1]. Undeclared
                            variables are able to be deleted while declared variables are not. Using strict mode and always declaring variables is recommended.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            var hoisting ensures that all variables are processed before code execution. Because variables are able to be declared at any point in the code you
                            can even declare them after their use and the program will still function. It's because of hoisting that this works. It's as if the variable declarations 
                            are hoisted above the executing code. However it's recommended to always declare your variables at the top of their scope. [1] Functions are also
                            hoisted up so that they are available when called. However if they are defined as expressions (i.e. var f => function(){}) they are not hoisted and 
                            can cause undefined errors [4].
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            let is another keyword used to declare and initialize a variable. Like var multiple variables can be declared in one statement separated by commas.
                            "let allows you to declare variables that are limited to block, statement, or expression scope in which it is used" [2]. This is different than var
                            because var defines the variable globally or locally within a function regardless of block scope [2].
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            const is a keyword that functions very similarly to let. You must initialize the variable at the time of declaration because const represents
                            a variable that cannot be reassigned. It is read-only. However if you assign an object to a const variable the properties of that object can 
                            change values. "A constant cannot share its name with a function or a variable in the same scope" and it is affected by the temporal dead zone
                            (as let is as well) [3]. const is useful in functional programming.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The temporal dead zone refers to the time between declaring a variable and initializing it (once the initialization is terminated). let variables 
                            are hoisted up like var variables however var variables are inherently initialized as undefined where let variables are not. So accessing them 
                            prior to initialization will throw a reference error. Using typoeof on a variable in the temporal dead zone will also throw a reference error. [2]

                           If a variable is defined outside of a block (i.e. code encapsulated with curly braces {}) then that variable has a global scope [3]. 
                           This is actually only true for web browsers; it's different when using JavaScipt with Node.js for example [2]. It's not recommended
                           to use the global scope. A naming collision is one reason (if a variable name is used more than once in several parts of the code) [3]. 
                           Variables redeclared using var are at the same global scope as previous declarations so the variable will be assigned the new value 
                           and overwrite the old value, so be careful here.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Local scope refers to variables defined within a particular block of code or function (i.e. within curly braces {}). For function scope, variables
                            defined within the function are only accessible from within that function at the time it's called. Using const or let within a block (inside curly 
                            braces) causes these variables to be only accessible from within that block.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Functions don't have access to one another's variables even if one is calling another [3]. However, because of lexical scoping, when defining a 
                            function within another one, the inner function can access the outer function's variables and all the way up to the global scope. The more global something is 
                            the less it has access to because it can't access inner variables and functions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Closures are a related topic. In short this is when a function returns another function. This can be helpful when you need to reuse a unit of work (or instance a function that does 
                            asynchronous work to look up some data based on changing user input) [3]. Closures can also be used to return private variables and these functions are known to be privileged 
                            functions [3]. CSS-Tricks.com's article linked below has a good example of closures and privileged functions. Closures retain the scope of the variables created within them 
                            which is how they are able to function. CSS-Trick.com's explains that closures are generally used to do two things: to control side effects and to create private variables [3].

                        <h5>this</h5>
                        <p>
                           'this' represents the JavaScript context object in which the current code is executing [1]. When outside of a function 'this' refers to the global object whether
                           in strict mode or not [1]. There are other differences between 'this' in strict and non-strict mode. The value of 'this' is determined by how a function is called.
                           'this' can't be set during execution and may be different each time the function is called [1]. bind() has been introduced to set the value of 'this' for a function
                           regardless of how it's called [1].
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When not in strict mode, and when a value of 'this' isn't set by a function call, 'this' will default to the global context [1]. When in strict mode 'this' will 
                            default to whatever it was set to right before the call [1]. The value of 'this' can be passed from one context to another using the call() or apply() method [1].
                            When the value passed as 'this' to call or apply is not an object, internally a call to ToObject will convert the input (for example a primitive) to an object.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            bind was introduced in ECMAScript 5. This binds the context of 'this' to whatever argument was passed into bind. It is permanently bound regardless of how the 
                            function is called later. For arrow functions "this will retain the value of the enclosing lexical context's this" [1]. If you use call, bind, or apply
                            with arrow functions the 'this' argument (the first argument) will be ignored. When using those methods with an arrow function null should be passed in
                            for the first argument [1].
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When a function is called as a method of an object 'this' refers to the calling object itself [1]. This is true whether the function was defined inline with the
                            object definition or assigned later separately [1]. This is also true for an object's prototype chain. Objects will inherit functions from their prototype 
                            and 'this' will refer to the concrete object [1]. The same can be said when a function is invoked as a getter or a setter--'this' is bound to the object [1].
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When 'this' is used in a constructor it is bound to the new object being constructed. The variables assigned with the new statement will have the properties set
                            on 'this' during construction. If an object is returned from the constructor method then that object is bound to the variable assigned with the new statement.
                            In that case any references to 'this' in the constructor are essentially dead code as it has no affects [1].
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For DOM events 'this' is set to the element that fired the event. Although some browsers don't follow that convention for listeners added with methods other than 
                            addEventListener [1]. When inline event handlers are used 'this' is set to the DOM element on which the listener is placed [1].
                        </p>
                        <h5>Events</h5>
                        <p>
                            Events are fired in response to actions taken by the user or program. As users interact with a web page for example it can be useful to know that they clicked
                            a button. In response to clicking that button a user may be logged in or a modal might display with relevant information. There are many different types of events.
                            For instance keyboard keys being pressed, clicking, form submission, the loading of a page, or when errors occur. Programming around events is important in 
                            any program with user interaction and is not limited to the web. The MDN - DOM Event Reference below lists all of the different events that can occur in the browser [3].
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Each event has an "event handler" which is "registered" when a block of code is defined to be run in response to an event [2]. Listeners wait for an event to occur
                            and the handler runs the specific code in response. "It's important to note that web events are not part of the core JavaScript language. They are defined as part of the
                            JavaScript APIs built into the browser" [2].
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Event handlers can be registered to elements using JavaScript. First one needs a reference to the element and from there one can assign
                            functions to the various event handler properties (i.e. onblur, onkeypress, onmouseover). We are also able to assign event handlers inline
                            within the HTML code (as event handler HTML attributes), however that's not recommended [2]. This is because it can quickly become unmanageable 
                            and inefficient [2]. The current recommended mechanism is to use the addEventListener() and removeEventListener() functions to add and remove event handlers.
                            This lets us easily add and remove different event handlers for different purposes. These methods also allow us to apply multiple event handlers
                            to the same event handler property. Trying to assign two different functions to the same property normally overwrites the first because the 
                            event property is assigned a new value. When using addEventListener we can get around this limitation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Event handlers often pass in the event object to the handler method. This is generally seen in the parameter list named as "e". This event object has a 
                            reference to the element that just fired the event. You can access this object through the event object's "target" property. [2]
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Preventing default behavior is something that you will run across from time to time. One example that MDN describes is preventing a form from being 
                            submitted when a user clicks the submit button. You would want to prevent the user from submitting a bad form and instead display validation information
                            before actually submitting the data to the server. Whenever you have custom logic you would like to apply and circumvent the default behavior use the event
                            object's "preventDefault()" method to stop it from occurring. [2] You can also set the event's return value by setting the event.ReturnValue property.
                            Finally returning false for a given event will prevent the form from being submitted (i.e. onsubmit="return false" where false would be the returned value
                            from a method call).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Bubbling and capturing are two advanced event topics that are important to understand. If an element causes two events to fire and each affects one another 
                            negatively this will need to be addresses in your code. For example, if an element should hide when an area of the screen is clicked but also play a video 
                            in response to a similar event that is also triggered at the same time (as MDN uses in their example [2]). When events are fired there are two phases.
                            The "capturing" of the event phase which runs an event handler if one is registered in response. The capturing phase checks each ancestor of the element triggering
                            the event and works its way from the outer most ancestor (the html element) down to the closest parent until it stops at the original element. In the "bubbling" 
                            phase the opposite occurs. It checks to see if the element that triggered the event has an event handler which should respond and moves up the hierarchy (all 
                            the way up to the html element). By default event handlers are registered during the bubbling phase [2]. To prevent issues like this the stopPropagation()
                            method can be used. It will stop the bubbling up process so other handlers are not run. This can be invoked by calling the stopPropagation() method on the event object.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The addEventListener method has another parameter which determines if the event should execute during the capturing phase or not. It is default to false and thus the bubbling phase
                            is when the event will fire. MDN notes that if the event listener is "attached to the event target, the event is in the target phase, rather than the capturing and bubbling phases. Events
                            in the target phase will trigger all listeners on an element in the order they were registered, regardless of the useCapture parameter" [4]. The addEventListener method allows you to 
                            add multiple listeners to the same element rather than setting a specific property on an element, for example onload (which only allows you to set one method).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Event delegation is another related concept. Instead of registering handlers on child objects you can instead register an event on a parent element. For
                            example if you have a series of list items. If you wanted a message to pop up when an item is clicked you could register an event listener on the parent element 
                            instead. The event would then bubble to the items [2]. This can be helpful if child elements are dynamically changing. The event delegation technique allows the 
                            parent to handle the event and determine if a child is affected or not, then responds appropriately.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Here's a historical note MDN points out: "why bother with both capturing and bubbling? Well, in the bad old days when browsers were much less cross-compatible than 
                            they are now, Netscape only used event capturing, and Internet Explorer used only event bubbling. When the W3C decided to try to standardize the behavior and reach a 
                            consensus, they ended up with this system that included both, which is the one modern browsers implemented." [2]

                            Objects are an important building block in programming. Knowing what objects exist in a language natively is important because often times
                            they are there for a reason. Often they encapsulate actions and processes that many programmers utilize frequently. Being able to extend 
                            the default functionality with your own custom functions is an important technique as well. JavaScript has its own way of doing such 
                            things in its use of prototypes. However in some cases adding behavior to native objects is considered to be a bad practice and should be 
                            avoided depending on your situation.

                            There are many globally scoped objects in JavaScript [1]. The resource link below goes to MDN's listing of
                            all the global objects in various categories. To name a few there are values such as Infinity, NaN, undefined, null, and globalThis. There
                            are functions such as eval(), isFinite(), isNaN(), parseFloat(), decodeURI(), escape(), and unescape(). There are fundamental objects like
                            Object, Function, Boolean, Error, and ReferenceError. Other types include Number, BigInt, Math, Date, String, RegExp, Array, Map, Set, 
                            WeakMap, and WeakSet. There are control abstractions like Promise, Generator, GeneratorFunction, and AsyncFunction. There is Reflect and Proxy
                            for reflection. There are internationalization objects like Intl and Intl.DateTimeFormat. And finally WebAssembly objects like WebAssembly, 
                            WebAssembly.Module, and WebAssembly.Instance. Knowing what's available for use is half the battle so taking time to review the native objects
                            is important. Next, spend some time practicing using them.

                            A JS object is a collection of properties and a property is an association between a key and a value [1]. These values can be primitives
                            or even whole functions. You can create a new object like so: var myObject = new Object(); and then you can assign properties and values to it
                            using dot-notation. For example, myObject.name = "My new object"; If you declare a property with no value it will default to the value of undefined. Most of the time
                            properties will be accessed using dot-notation however you can also access and set them using bracket notation. For example myObject['name'] 
                            will return "My new object" which we defined earlier. Objects are sometimes called associative arrays [1]. You can even iterate over objects
                            like an array to access the different property values (for example MDN uses a for...in loop to print out each property and its value in their example) [1]. There 
                            are actually three built-in ways in ECMAScript 5 to enumerate the properties of an object. The for...in loop (includes all enumerable prototype chain properties), the 
                            Object.keys(o) method (which does not include prototype properties), and the Object.getOwnPropertyNames(o) method which returns all property names on a given object
                            (enumerable or not) [1]. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There are several ways to create new objects. You can use the object initializer or create a constructor method. It's easy to new up an object using the
                            initializer. Remember that objects are just collections of properties. You can define these by hand by declaring key and value pairs. For example: 
                            const myObject = { propertyOne: valueOne, propertyTwo: valueTwo }; The values can be any type (for example a number or a string value). These objects are of 
                            type Object (as if a call to new Object() were made) [1]. Object initializers are expressions and each time it's called this results in a new object being created
                            and these distinct objects won't compare to each other as being equal [1].
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You can also define object types by defining constructor methods. By convention we capitalize constructor methods. We can then use the "new" keyword to create
                            a new instance of the object. To create a constructor simply define a function with a capitalized name which represent the object type. Within this method
                            you can assign properties to the new object and assign values to them either by taking in arguments and assigning them to the properties or by assigning them in a 
                            different way (for example by hard coding initial values or by calling other methods which return a value). The keyword "this" is used to assign values to the 
                            object's properties. For example, function Person(name) { this.name = name; }; This constructor creates a Person object and takes one argument which is assigned to the property "name".
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Constructor methods can be called from the objects themselves because the constructor is a method attached to the object. So you are able to create a new Person object with the following 
                            syntax: var anotherPerson = new personOne.constructor('New Name'); Just remember to use the "new" keyword and pass in required parameters. This can be useful if you don't have access to the original
                            constructor for whatever reason [2]. It can also be useful if you want to know the name of the original object that it is an instance of. You can find this using the name property, like 
                            anotherPerson.constructor.name. However this value can change for a variety of reasons (for example transpilers, binding, and inheritance) so using the instanceof operator 
                            is better in some cases, as explained by MDN [2].
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Remember that we can add properties to objects by simply using dot notation. For example person.age = 10; This would add the age property to the existing
                            object named person. However it won't affect other existing Person objects, only this one [1]. To affect all Person objects the Person constructor would
                            need to be updated to include the new property.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Finally we can create objects using the Object.create method. "This method can be very useful, because it allows you to choose the prototype object for the object you want to create,
                            without having to define a constructor function" [1]. Create makes a new object using the given object parameter as the prototype. So the new object's __proto__ property will
                            refer to the passed in object and its available members [2].
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As was described earlier object properties can be accessed by either dot notation (myObject.name) or bracket notation (myObject['name']). You are also able to index into object properties
                            using indexed bracket notation (for example myObject[2] = "Hello World!"). Once you define a property by either indexing or using a property name you can only access
                            it using the same technique (so you couldn't access the last property using dot notation as in myObject.2). The exception is array-like objects reflected from HTML [1].
                            "For example, if the second FORM tag in a document has a NAME attribute of "myForm", you can refer to the form as document.forms[1] or document.forms["myForm"] or document.forms.myForm" [1].
                        </p>

                            As MDN explains, "prototypes are the mechanism by which JavaScript objects inherit features from one another" [1]. JS is a prototype based language. 
                            This means that inheritance is achieved through the use of prototype objects. These are templates that the "child" object can inherit methods and properties
                            from. The "base" prototype objects may inherit functionality from yet another prototype which can link many classes together. This is often referred to as the prototype
                            chain. "The properties and methods are defined on the prototype property on the objects' constructor function, not on the object instances themselves" [1]. By walking up
                            this chain we can access the various properties and methods available to us [1].
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            All objects inherit properties and methods from the Object prototype by default. So each object has members like watch and valueOf [1]. When a member that's inherited is called
                            the browser first checks to see if the current object has a matching member to call, otherwise it goes up the chain of prototypes until it finds a match [1]. These members (properties
                            and methods) are not copied to the child objects--they are accessed by walking up the prototype chain [1]. The methods and properties that are inherited from the prototype object are 
                            only the members on the prototype object, and not ones defined directly on the parent object itself. So for example as MDN explains, Object.keys() and Object.is() are not available
                            to the inheriting class because those are defined on the Object constructor itself. However members such as watch() and valueOf() are available because these are defined on the prototype object.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To modify the prototype chain of an object simply access the prototype property and add a property or method using dot notation. For example: person.prototype.fullName = function() { 
                            return this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName; }. This will add a method called fullName to all Person objects. This is true even if you've already created an object of type Person. Its prototype will be 
                            updated and the new method will be available. You can also do this for properties but that is only useful for static fields since these are shared among all instances of 
                            an object type. MDN explains that using the constructor method to define properties and then adding methods to the object's prototype separately is a good practice to separate and group the logic [1].
                            Being able to modify an object's prototype, which affects all instances of the same type, is quite a powerful and useful feature.

                            Inheritance in JavaScript is accomplished within constructor methods. We have to utilize the call() method within the constructor. The child object must define a constructor which 
                            calls the parent object's call method. The call method takes a parameter which specifies that value of 'this' when the function runs. The rest of the parameters are the 
                            parent's regular constructor arguments.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As MDN explains there is more to do to properly set up inheritance. We also need to set the child's prototype to be an object of the parent's type.
                            For example,  Warrior.prototype = Object.create(Person.prototype); The create method will return an object which has a prototype of the same type as the parameter passed in.
                            By doing this we'll ensure the child prototype has all the methods available from the parent object's prototype. The last thing we must do is make sure that the child constructor
                            returns an object of its type, and not its parent's type. We accomplish this by adding one more line of code: Object.defineProperty(Warrior.prototype, 'constructor', {
                            value: Warrior, enumerable: false, writable: true }); This will ensure we create an object of the desired type. Finally to define new functionality for an existing method 
                            inherited from the parent simply define the same method on the child's prototype. All of what has been discussed is just one way to implement inheritance. Frameworks
                            and new features of ECMAScript allow for classes and other common constructs like the extends keyword. [1]
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As MDN summarizes, there are three major groups of object members to remember. Ones defined inside of a constructor method that are given to object instances. Ones that
                            are defined on the constructors themselves which are only available on the constructor. And finally ones that are on a constructor's prototype which are accessible from
                            instances and inheriting objects. [1]
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            ECMAScript2015 added class syntax which is much like what you would find in languages such as Java, C#, and C++. If you have a background with those OO languages you will quickly understand
                            the class syntax in ECMAScript2015. Classes have a constructor method, class methods, and properties. MDN explains that underneath it all the class syntax is being converted to prototypical 
                            inheritance models (class syntax is just "syntactic sugar" to reduce code and feel more consistent with other languages many developers utilize) [1]. To inherit using this syntax we
                            use the extends keyword. For example: class Warrior extends Character { constructor() { super(); } } The call to super is important and must be done first. This way the parent
                            class will be able to initialize 'this' and correctly set up any references [1]. Remember to pass along any required parameters to the parent's constructor by passing them 
                            into the call to super(). Adding getters and setters is also common depending on the intended use of your object. These return and set values of instance fields and ECMAScript2015 has syntax 
                            for creating them. To add a getter and setter to the Warrior class from above use the following syntax (which also requires an _attackPower field on the class):
                        </p>
                        <pre>
                            get attackPower() { 
                                return this._attackPower; 
                            }

                            set attackPower(power) {
                                this._attackPower = power;
                            }
                        </pre>
                        <p>
                            Getters and setters are common patterns for setting and returning a class field value. This paradigm has been around for a long time. Not every field needs a getter or a setter and if you are adding these
                            you might want to spend a little more time considering why you are adding them and if another mechanism would be better (as far as encapsulation and abstraction goes). [1]
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Inheritance is a powerful tool which allows for reuse. Functionality that we want to be reused among related but subtly different objects can be inherited from a base class and then
                            extended for custom behavior. Too much inheritance can add unnecessary complexity to a project. Depending on your need composition may be a better choice. In the end inheritance 
                            is just another tool in your toolbox and shouldn't be the hammer for all of your problems. There are a lot of benefits from using it but it has its place like any other tool. [1]

                        To extend native object behavior it's as simple as modifying the native object's prototype chain. There can be downsides to doing this though. By extending native
                        objects you are changing or adding behavior to something many people understand as behaving one way. When new contributors work with your code you will need to teach them
                        of these changes. The other downside is that as time goes on the native objects may grow to include the same functionality that you've added yourself. So you might run into collisions
                        with native functionality as the language evolves. When adding properties one good thing to keep in mind is to use non-enumerable properties. This way your additional 
                        functionality will be hidden from the normal ways of viewing all of an object's properties (for example a for loop or Object.keys()). To do so use the Object.defineProperty method
                        and set the property to enumerable: false. This prevents things like JSON.stringify(object) from seeing your new properties. [1][2]

                            Validating user input is a critical part of software development. With security becoming an even more important part of the development process making sure to validate and sanitize
                            user input is an important step in that process. Apart from wanting to make sure the user enters in meaningful data we must also be concerned with malicious attacks. SQL or JavaScript
                            injection can cause havoc to a software system if input is not sanitized before saving. In this section we'll explore HTML5's input types and attributes which can be used to validate
                            form data.

                            There are different ways to validate form data. On the client-side we can use JavaScript and create custom validations. We are also able to use built-in form validation. While not as customizable
                            built-in form validation is more performant than custom JS validation. On the server-side we always want to validate incoming data before further processing or saving occurs.
                            If the data isn't in the right format, or appears to be malicious, we certainly don't want to save it. Be sure to always validate and sanitize your data. [1]
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To use HTML5's built-in validations we need to use different attributes to mark the forms. These allow us to specify if the input is required, has any limits, or is formatted correctly for example.
                            When an element is valid MDN explains that there are several things we can rely upon. First, the element will match the :valid CSS pseudo-class. Second, the browser will be able to submit the form (unless 
                            custom JS is preventing it). Third, when the element is invalid it will match the :invalid CSS pseudo-class and the browser will display an error if the user tries to submit the form.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Below is a simple form example using a text input box and a submit button. Using the same CSS that MDN uses in their input example the input's border is a red dashed line when the field is invalid.
                            Once the input has some text value the border becomes a solid black line. These are controlled by the pseudo-classes :invalid and :valid targeting the input element.
                        </p>
                        <form>
                            <label for="validate-name">Please enter your name.</label>
                            <input id="validate-name" type="text" required placeholder="Enter your name!"/>
                            <button>Submit</button>
                        </form>
                        <p>
                            The following example uses the pattern attribute to match the input to a specific pattern that's expected. For example you could use the pattern to check for email addresses. The textarea element doesn't 
                            support the pattern attribute and using the email input type automatically takes care of the validation for us so we don't have to supply our own email regex [1].
                        </p>
                        <form>
                            <label for="validate-email">Please enter your email.</label>
                            <input id="validate-email" type="text" required placeholder="Enter your email!" pattern="[a-z0-9!#$%&'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+(?:\.[a-z0-9!#$%&'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+)*@(?:[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?\.)+(?:[A-Z]{2}|com|org|net|gov|mil|biz|info|mobi|name|aero|jobs|museum)\b"/>
                            <label for="validate-alt-email">Please enter your alternate email.</label>
                            <input id="validate-alt-email" type="email" required placeholder="Enter your alternate email!"/>
                            <button>Submit</button>
                        </form>
                        <p>
                            Other examples of validation include restricting the minimum and maximum input length of input or textarea elements, adding similar min and max restrictions for number input types, or limiting date ranges 
                            on month input types. Along with all of this built-in validation we can create custom validation messages. There are two drawbacks according to MDN, one is that there is no standard way to style them using 
                            CSS, and the other is that these depend on the browser locale so it's possible that the web page could be displayed in one language and the validation message could be displayed in another [1]. In order to 
                            add the validation we must use JavaScript using the constraint validation API [1]. The email example above uses this for custom messages. These are displayed when the input changes and then the button is clicked.
                        </p>
                        <p> 
                            The constraint validation API has three important methods. checkValidity() which returns true if there are no validation problems and false otherwise. It also causes the element to fire an invalid event.
                            HTMLFormElement.reportValidity() returns true if the element and its children are valid. It returns false when they are invalid and invalid events are fired for each validation error. The setCustomValidity()
                            method is used to set custom validation messages or clear existing ones and it was used in the email example above [1]. Finally we can use pure JS to add validation but it requires a lot more work than newer 
                            techniques which do much of the work for us. You would want to consider alternatives before adding your own JS code or consider why you must write custom logic (which might be a requirement in some situations) [1].
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Finally there are a number of different input types. These range from classic types like button, text, radio, and checkbox to types like color, email, search, date, and url. The full list can be 
                            found using the MDN link below [2]. Common attributes among all input types include autocomplete, autofocus, disabled, form, list, name, readonly, required, tabindex, type, and value. Each input type
                            has additional attributes specific for its own use. Using labels is highly recommended (this also helps with accessibility) and while placeholder text can be helpful be sure to use these for examples of valid input, 
                            not as prompts for information (although many pages do this it shouldn't technically be used as a label) [2].

                            The application cache can be used to store files offline and reduce server load [1]. However MDN does not recommend using this feature as the application cache is being 
                            removed from the web standard and should no longer be supported. Service workers are encouraged instead. That said here is a bit of information on the topic in case you run
                            into them in legacy applications.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When using the app cache feature you must define and specify a manifest file. This file is then set within the HTML tag's attribute list using the manifest attribute. Each 
                            page that you intend to cache should include this attribute. You can however specify specific pages within the manifest file itself to cache them (known as master entries) [1]. The browser 
                            automatically adds visited pages to the cache if the manifest attribute is set. MDN notes that some browsers notify the user and ask if they want to allow caching when the 
                            browser detects a site that uses the cache. In general the browser checks if the cache exists, loads cached files, then checks if the server has an updated manifest file and 
                            downloads that and any new files listed. In order to clear the cache manually you need to clear out the browsing history for your particular internet browser.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Manifest File</h5>
                        <p>
                            This file has a MIME type of text/cache-manifest. The files can have comments using the pound/hashtag symbol (#) at the beginning of the comment. The files must have three sections: CACHE, NETWORK, and FALLBACK.
                            If a header is not specified it is defaulted to CACHE. The browser loads a new manifest if the file has changed (byte for byte) so including a version number in a comment can
                            be helpful so it can detect a change. Also MDN notes that you should never include the manifest file itself in the manifest for caching because then it is nearly impossible to update it. [1]
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>CACHE: Files listed here are explicitly cached.</li>
                            <li>NETWORK: These files require a connection to the server. Requests bypass the cache. The wildcard character * can be used once. Useful for security reasons.</li>
                            <li>FALLBACK: Specifies fallback pages the browser can use if a resource is not accessible. These include the initial resource to attempt to load and a fallback uri.</li>

                        <p>
                            The app cache has a number of states including: UNCACHED (cache object is not fully initialized), IDLE (cache is not currently being updated), CHECKING (fetching and checking for updates), 
                            DOWNLOADING (change in manifest has caused new files to be downloaded), UPDATEREADY (new version is available for download), and OBSOLETE (cache group is obsolete). [1]

                            CSS has a vast amount of things to learn because of all of its capabilities. Styling HTML elements is important in UI and UX design and there is a ton out there to learn. 
                            One of the fundamental things to start with though is text styling. Ultimately web pages convey information and text is the most utilized way of doing that. Taking concepts 
                            from print we can style text in ways that make it helpful to the readers. Using clear headers and consistent font throughout helps our eyes navigate the page and content. 
                            In this section we'll look at several ways to style text.

                            affect the spacing of the letters, the space between lines, and alignment. Text within an element is all styled together (unless you wrap specific text in another element and target
                            it specifically--like wrapping it in a span element for example). [1] It's possible to color text using the color CSS property. This can be a word like 'red' or an RBG or 
                            Hexadecimal value for instance (among others). Font families allow you to change the font of text. You can also supply fallback fonts in case the user doesn't have a specific font installed on their computer.
                            Some fonts are "web safe" meaning that these are supported across all systems and are great default fonts to choose from. These include Arial, Georgia, and Times New Roman. [1]
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Font size takes a value in various units and scales the text appropriately. Examples of acceptable units include percentages, pixels (px), ems, rems, and even named values (like xx-small, large, and relative 
                            size like smaller and larger). Font size can also take several global values such as inherit, initial, and unset. Commonly used units include px, ems, and rems. Pixels specify
                            how tall you want the text to be. It's an absolute unit in most situations. ems are "equal to the font size set on the parent element of the current element (more specifically, the width
                            of a capital letter M contained inside the parent element) [1]. It's possible to scale other things using ems. Finally rems are like ems "except that 1rem is equal to the font size set on the
                            root element of the document (i.e. html), not the parent element" [1]. By default font-size is inherited and is defaulted to 16px as a standard [1]. 1em is 16px by default but these scale to 
                            whatever the font-size is set to which make them powerful in CSS. MDN notes that it can be helpful to work off of rems and to default the font-size to 10px so that the math is easier to work with
                            when styling other sections of the page [1].

                            Here's an example of styling text. <span class="red-georgia">This text is colored and has a Georgia font family. If your browser doesn't support Georgia it will fall back to Times New Roman, then to Times, and 
                            finally to a serif font. </span><span class="small-text">These fallbacks are also known as a font stack.</span>

                            Below is another example of styling text which changes the font-size, font-family, and color of the text. It also includes an example of hyphenation and drop shadow around text. Hyphens can be
                            applied manually or automatically by the browser. You can add hyphenation points that render all the time (& hyphen ;) or that are invisible until rendered (& shy ;). When adding shadows you are able
                            to specify the horizontal and vertical positioning of the shadow as well as its radius and color.

                            There are a couple other important word-wrapping CSS properties. These are word-wrap and word-break. Word-wrap was a nonstandard Microsoft property but it is now officially overflow-wrap. This 
                            can have one of three values: normal, anywhere, and break-word. This controls if the browser should insert line breaks into text to stop text from overflowing. Normal breaks on normal word breaks
                            (like spaces), anywhere breaks anywhere within a word and no hyphen is added, and break-word is just like anywhere but it does not consider soft-wrapping opportunities (like spaces that can also be broke on). [4]
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Word-break also affects text wrapping. MDN explains that it "sets whether line breaks appear wherever the text would otherwise overflow its content box" [5]. Its values include: normal (uses the 
                            default line break), break-all (word breaks can be inserted between any two characters except for Chinese/Japanese/Korean text), keep-all (word breaks should not be used for Chinese/Japanese/Korean text, others default to normal), 
                            and break-word (same effect as "normal" and "overflow-wrap: anywhere" regardless of the overflow-wrap property) [5].
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            MDN explains that there are four common properties that alter the weight and emphasis of text [1]. Those are font-style, font-weight, text-transform, and text-decoration. font-style is 
                            used to make the text italicized. There are three settings. Normal where the text is displayed in its default state, italic which will display the font's italic version, and oblique
                            which will slant the normal version of the font. If an italic version doesn't exist the font will be oblique by default. font-weight sets how bold the text is. This can take one of many 
                            different values such as normal or bold, or even lighter or bolder (which set the font one step more or less bold compared to the parent's value). Finally it can take a numeric value from 
                            100 to 900. text-transform allows you to transform the font by uppercasing it, lowercasing it, capitalizing it, or applying a full-width style. text-decoration allows you to add lines around
                            or through the text (such as underneath, over or through). Multiple text decorations can be applied at once. I've added examples of these above in the Pokémon card example.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It's also possible to align text using the text-align property. This property has several values including left, right, center, and justify. These align text like a word processor. Text is either
                            moved to the left, right or centered in the middle of the element. Justify spreads out the text varying the gaps in between letters to fill the width of the element. The following example is justified.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The line-height property is used to adjust the spacing between lines. This property can take most length and size units but can also take a unitless value which multiplies
                            the font-size value [1]. MDN notes that generally a spacing of 1.5 or 2 is preferred. You can see an example of this below. You can also adjust the spacing between words and letters
                            specifically by using the letter-spacing and word-spacing properties. Again these take most length and size units.
                        </p>
                        <p class="justify">
                            This text has been justified to fill the element. Notice the gaps in between the letters so that all of the lines of text have the same width. <span class="spacing">This can look bad depending on the styles of the 
                            other elements around it.</span> Ultimately consider user readability and user experience when styling anything.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            MDN lists a number of additional properties that you can use to style your text including font-variant, font-kerning, font-stretch, text-indent, text-overflow, white-space, and text-align-last just to 
                            name a few. There is also a shorthand way to add many font styling properties together on one line. The font property allows for this and only requires a font-size and font-family. The order of the values is: font-variant, 
                            font-weight, font-stretch, font-size, line-height, and font-family [1]. MDN explains that a forward slash must be placed between the font-size and line-height properties. Here is MDN's example: font: italic 
                            normal bold normal 3em/1.5 Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
                        </p>
                        <p class="font-css-example">

                        <h5>@font-face</h5>
                        <p>
                            Earlier we discussed web safe fonts. If you decide to use a unique font you can use the CSS @font-face at-rule to load the font either from the user's local computer (if they have it installed)
                            or from a URL which will download the font for the user [3]. It's a good idea to provide several options in case the user doesn't have a font installed or for when a font just isn't available. 
                            @font-face can use the following file types: woff, woff2, truetype, opentype, embedded-opentype, and svg [3]. woff refers to the Web Open Font Format developed by Mozilla together with Type Supply, LettError,
                            and other organizations [2]. This format is similar to others and uses the same sfnt structure that is used by TrueType, OpenType, and Open Font Format but includes additional metadata and
                            private-use data structures [2]. Some of the benefits include compressed data for using less bandwidth and that, generally, vendors like the format and are willing to support it (where they 
                            might not license their TrueType or OpenType format fonts). There are two WOFF formats. WOFF and WOFF2 differ mainly in the algorithms used for compression according to MDN [2].

                            As MDN notes, "the CSS box model is the foundation of layout on the Web" [1]. Every element is basically a box that can be scaled and styled in various ways. Each has its own
                            default set of properties (for example a div has a block display property by default). Each element has content, padding, a border, and a margin "built up around one another like the
                            layers of an onion" [1]. You can see this by opening the dev tools of your browser and inspecting an element. The dev tools usually have a diagram which depicts this sort of thing. 
                            Below is an example of this.

                            Each element has a size, border, padding and margins that can be styled. The size of an element can be adjusted using the width and height properties. There 
                            are also min and max properties for the width and height. Padding is used to separate content within an element from the sides of the border. Likewise, margin is used to
                            separate other elements from the outside of an element's border. You can style the top, right, bottom, and left values separately. There is also shorthand for doing parallel 
                            sides or all at once. The border can be styled to have rounded corners (by giving the border a radius) and the style can be adjusted (to display a solid line or a dashed
                            border for instance).

                            Margin collapsing is something that occurs between sibling elements (those on the same level in the DOM). If the top and bottom margins are set between two elements these
                            are merged into one single margin. The value will be whichever margin is the larger of the two. Margins of floating and absolutely positioned elements never collapse [2]. Margins 
                            will be collapsed when there is no border, padding, inline content, height, min-height, block formatting context or clearance (see clear) set for an element in general. Ultimately
                            if there is no reason for the space to exist (for example an empty block) it will be collapsed.

                        <p>
                            The overflow property controls how content that overflows an element behaves. If you set absolute values for the width and height it's possible that in some cases the
                            content will overflow the box. You can set the overflow property to one of three values: auto (which hides the content and adds scroll bars), hidden (which just hides the content 
                            that overflows), or visible (which shows the content overflowing from the element and is generally the default behavior) [1].

                        <p>
                            The filter-function can be used to change the appearance of an image and is used in the filter and background-filter properties [5]. This function "applies
                            graphical effects like blur and color shift to an element." [6] These can be used to adjust images, backgrounds, and borders as MDN explains [6]. The full list of filter 
                            functions includes [5]:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>blur: blurs an image (radius - length)</li>
                            <li>brightness: can make the image brighter or darker (amount - number or percentage)</li>
                            <li>contrast: changes the contrast of the image (amount - number or percentage)</li>
                            <li>drop-shadow: adds a shadow to the image (length offset x and y, blur radius length, spread-radius length, and a color)</li>
                            <li>grayscale: converts an image to greyscale (amount - number or percentage)</li>
                            <li>hue-rotate: adjusts the hue of an image (angle)</li>
                            <li>invert: inverts the colors of the image (amount - number or percentage)</li>
                            <li>opacity: adjusts the transparency of the image (amount - number or percentage. 0 = transparent, 1 = opaque)</li>
                            <li>saturate: adjusts the saturation of the image (amount - number or percentage)</li>
                            <li>sepia: converts the image to sepia (which is a reddish-brown color which can "warm" the image) (amount - number or percentage)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Below are examples of some of these functions.
                        </p>
                        <img class="filter-example-1" src="rock.jpg" alt="A greyscale blurry image of a rock wall." />
                        <img class="filter-example-2" src="rock.jpg" alt="A transparent image of a rock wall." />
                        <img class="filter-example-3" src="rock.jpg" alt="An inverted, sepia image of a rock wall." />

                        <p>
                            Other effects include adding transparency to an element, adding background images, gradients, shadows, and clipping. According to MDN by default the background-color and image properties extend
                            to the edge of the border of an element [1]. This can be adjusted using the background-clip property. The background color also defaults to transparent, meaning that other background elements will
                            show through. You can also set this specifically and could be helpful if an element already has a color defined for instance.
                        </p>
                        <div class="background">
                            <p class="background-info">This element has a background image and I have adjusted its opactiy.</p>

                        <p>
                            Backgrounds can be clipped using the background-clip property. This has four keywords which are described below. There are also several global values which are inherit, initial, and unset.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>border-box (which extends all the way to the outside edge of the element's border, this is also the default value used) [2]</li>
                            <li>padding-box (which extends up to the padding of an element)</li>
                            <li>content-box (which goes to the outside edge of the element's content)</li>
                            <li>text (which effectively changes the text's color to be that of the background image by clipping it to the foreground of the text itself)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="background-text-clipping">This element has a background-clip set to content-box, so the image is clipped to the content of the element only.</p>
                        <p>
                            Other graphical effects include gradients and shadows. We saw text shadows earlier but you can also add shadows to elements with the box-shadow property. And 
                            another way to do gradients is with the linear-gradient property.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Gradients</h5>
                        <p>
                            Linear gradients use the background-image property but can also be declared using the shorthand background property [3]. The gradient defaults to top-to-bottom but can 
                            be set to left-to-right or any angle you'd like [3]. The angle can be specified using a degree value (i.e. 45deg) or by using keywords like "to top right" which would start
                            the gradient in the bottom left. You are also able to specify multiple colors and can even add "color stops" for hard edges rather than the fading effect. [3]
                            Gradients produce special image objects of the same name (i.e. the Gradient data type) so these can be used anywhere images can be used [4].
                        </p>
                        <p class="shadow-gradient">
                            This element has a box-shadow and a gradient applied to it!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Other gradient types include radial, conic, and repeating gradients. Below are examples of each.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Radial: start at a single point and radiate outwards from that point.</li>
                            <li>Conic: similar to radial however the gradient goes around in a circle rather than from a defined point in the center. (This is unsupported at this time.)</li>
                            <li>Repeating: these have radial and linear variants. Repeating gradients essentially create a pattern that is repeated over and over.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="radial-gradient">
                            This element has a radial gradient. It defaults to an ellipse in the center of the element. You can change the shape to a circle by specifying that in the gradient. 
                            Other starting point options include points such as top left. The gradient can stretch to different points of the element by using the following values: closest-corner, 
                            closest-side, farthest-corner, and farthest-side. As CSS-Tricks explains: "You can think of it like: 'I want this radial gradient to fade from the center point to the __(i.e. closest-side)_, and everywhere 
                            else fills in to accommodate that.' A radial gradient doesn't have to start at the default center either, you can specify a certain point by using "at ______" as part of the first parameter" [3].
                        </p>
                        <p class="radial-gradient-circle">
                            This element has a circular radial gradient starting at the bottom left corner.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Repeating gradients take the same arguments as linear and radial gradients but repeat the values in all directions [4].
                        </p>
                        <p class="repeating-gradient">
                            This element has a repeating linear gradient.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It's important to add fallbacks in case a particular browser doesn't support gradients. Ultimately supplying a picture can be a last resort.

                            As we have seen earlier (in the "Change location of an element" section) elements can be positioned with the position property. Other properties (like left and right) allow you to adjust the element's position
                            even further. As the official guide to the Microsoft exam explains, remember that each element has its own coordinate system. Elements within parent elements are positioned within the parent, and not 
                            within the page itself. So each element has its own origin rather than starting at the x and y coordinate of the entire web page (in the top left corner of the browser) [2].

                            The official guide to the exam also points out that the position properties start their measurements on the outer-most edge of the box model. Margins and padding will affect the model's 
                            position [2]. Check out the example below.
                        </p>

                            This is positioned and also has its margin and padding set. The margin and padding are still around this text, and the entire model (including the margin and padding) has been shifted using the 'top'
                            and 'left' CSS properties.

                            As we've discussed earlier having a flexible layout is important because in this day and age people use all sorts of devices when connecting to the web. From smartphones, 
                            to televisions, to desktop computers people use a variety of devices to connect to the web. Each of these have very different screen sizes so having a flexible design in your layout lends itself toward the user experience. 
                            In this section we'll revisit some of the earlier topics and add additional details about layouts.

                            We've already seen examples of the flexbox display type and many of its properties above in the Layout Container section. Here are some more details from the

                            As the official documentation explains, the flex layout allows content to be laid out to flow in any direction (left, right, up or down), allows for rearranging the element ordering, 
                            allows elements to dynamically resize given the allowable space, can be laid out along either a horizontal (main axis) or vertical (cross axis) and can also be
                            aligned in relation to siblings along the cross axis [1].
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Section 2 of the official documentation outlines various terms to know when discussing the flexbox layout [1]. 
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>main size: the width or height of a flex container or flex item, whichever is in the main dimension.</li>
                            <li>cross size: this functions the same as the main size but for the cross (perpendicular) axis.</li>
                            <li>main axis: the primary axis which flex items are laid out on, this extends from the main-start to the main-end.</li>
                            <li>cross axis: the axis which is perpendicular to the main axis. This extends from the cross-start to the cross-end.</li>
                            <li>main/cross-start and end: flex items are placed into the container beginning from the main-start and cross-start sides and extending toward the main-end and cross-end sides.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            There are two flex display properties. "flex" which generates a flex container that is block-level and "inline-flex" that generates a flex container that is inline-level [1]. While the flex
                            property behaves similarly to a block display there are differences. For instance the float and clear properties have no effect. Likewise for vertical-align. This is also true for the pseudo-elements
                            ::first-line and ::first-letter.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Anonymous flex items are created from text runs that are not wrapped in an element. White space is removed and the text is placed inside of an unstylable anonymous 
                            block container flex item [1].

                            Other notes include that absolute positioned flex items are positioned as if they are the sole item in the container. These don't fall into the flex layout of the container. Margins of adjacent 
                            flex items do not collapse. Items that are collapsed (visibility: collapse) leave the cross width intact so that the UI is consistent. [1]
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A note on the order property and accessibility from the W3C documentation points out that the order property only affects the visual display and does not affect non-visual media (such as speech) [1]. 
                            It also doesn't affect the default traversal order of sequential navigation modes. [1] 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Flex lines are used to layout the flex items. These can be single or multiple lines. This depends on if you allow the items to wrap around or not. [1] Much more detail on the flex box model
                            can be found within the W3C documentation linked below.

                            Multi-column layouts can help users consume content by displaying the content similarly to how newspapers and magazines do by using columns. This way people don't have to 
                            read long lines of text which sometimes cause readers to lose track of their place. Multi-column layouts shorten the text per line and make it easier to keep track of. [1] 
                        </p>
                        <p class="multi-column">
                            The two CSS properties to be aware of are column-count and column-width. These adjust the number of columns of text within an element and the line length (the width)
                            for each column [1]. This paragraph has four columns with a width set to 200 pixels. Whichever property ends up restricting the content the most will be used. 
                            You can also use the single property "column" to specify one or both of these values. The height of each column is balanced so you won't have to set this value manually.
                            That's actually specified in the CCS3 Column specification [1]. However as MDN explains you can actually specify a maximum height to determine when the text 
                            will overflow into another column. You can use the height or max-height properties to set this. Finally the column-gap property can be used to adjust the gap between
                            each column (this has a default value of 1em) [1]. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A few other properties to be aware of are column-rule, column-fill, and column-span. column-rule behaves like the border property. column-fill determines if the content will be 
                            balanced between the columns or not and column-span determines how far a particular element will span across the columns (like a header).

                            We know that floating items allows content to flow around them to the left or right. But that is limited to floated items. As infocodidy.com explains exclusions "provide a way to overcome this limitation with float" [1]. You apply exclusions
                            by setting the wrap-flow CSS property. The possible options include:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>auto: Default value. The element will be over top of the inline element.</li>
                            <li>both: Wraps the element smoothly on both sides.</li>
                            <li>start: The element will wrap only on the starting edge and the ending edge will be empty.</li>
                            <li>end: The element will wrap only on the ending edge and the starting edge will be empty.</li>
                            <li>maximum: The element will wrap on the largest side.</li>
                            <li>clear: The inline content will wrap on the top and bottom but leave the start and end edges empty.</li>

                        <p>
                            We discussed this topic within the Layout Container section above but here are some more details.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the past using HTML tables for layout was common. It provided a way to organize content but it is not very flexible and is cumbersome. Now we have ways to 
                            achieve similar results but in a much more modern way which is responsive to a user's screen size. We can use CSS to define that we will use 
                            a grid layout and then we can define the number of columns and rows to use within that grid. This is now fully baked into native CSS. At one point Microsoft 
                            had specific extensions of their own for use within IE and Edge (i.e. -ms-grid).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A grid can either be block-level or inline (which is set using grid or inline-grid for the display property). Grid items are not affected by some properties like 
                            float, display: inline-block, display: table-cell, vertical-align, or column-* [3]. When defining the columns and rows you can name each line of the grid if you'd like.
                            The column and row properties define the size and spacing of the grid. You can even use fractional units using the fr unit [3]. Fractional parts are calculated after
                            any non-flexible items to determine the correct space available.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The grid-area property specifies a name for an item and the grid-template-areas property can reference these grid-area names to define a template and
                            determine if elements span multiple spaces (which is set by repeating the name of an area multiple times in a row) [3]. grid-areas can also define a particular
                            area within the grid which uses four values (grid-row-start, grid-column-start, grid-row-end, and grid-column-end). When defining grid-template-areas you must be
                            sure that the template lists the same number of cells in each declaration. Empty cells can be specified with a period character (i.e. ".").
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            grid-templates are shorthand for grid-template-rows, grid-template-columns, and grid-template-areas. You can specify the rows and columns and default the areas to none, 
                            or even set all three properties with a slightly more complex syntax [3]. However CSS-Tricks.com recommends using the grid property instead because it implicitly resets the
                            grid-auto-columns, grid-auto-rows, and grid-auto-flow properties.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There are also controls for setting the space between the grids. You can do this by setting the grid-column-gap and grid-row-gap properties. There are ways to justify 
                            the content using the justify-items property (center, stretch, start, and end) and you can align items with the align-items property (center, stretch, start, and end) [3].
                            The entire contents of the grid can also be justified or aligned using the justify-content and align-content properties.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The grid-auto-flow properties tell the grid to either fill in more rows, columns, or empty space automatically (using the row, column, or dense values). The grid property is shorthand for
                            several properties including grid-template-rows, grid-template-columns, grid-template-areas, grid-auto-rows, grid-auto-columns, and grid-auto-flow.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Grid items have a number of properties that allow you to set where they each begin and end (for example grid-column-start, grid-column-end and equivalent row properties) [3]. 
                            These also have properties to justify and align their content. Below is a simple example of the grid layout.
                        </p>

                            Infocodify.com explains that regions are "a new CSS3 construct that allows you to have content flow through various regions in a webpage" [1]. In order to use regions the layout must implement two things. Those are a content source 
                            and regions which will display that content. This content can come from another web page with the use of an iframe or from another element on the page. Infocodify's article explains that at the time of their article this didn't work in all browsers [1].
                            Ultimately these mechanisms allow for content to fill in the defined regions similarly to how a magazine or newspaper is laid out where content is placed in grids and columns and the articles flow from page to page and around other things like advertisements. Using regions
                            allows you to add other elements in-between them and to pull your content from one source but have it placed on the page across all of the defined regions. The regions which the content flows over are called a 
                            region chain.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You are also able to control where content breaks and moves to a new region with the break-before, break-after, and break-inside properties. So you could use these to be sure
                            a heading of an article isn't the last line of a region and instead gets displayed in a new region with the beginning of its content. For instance this could be achieved by setting the 
                            break-after and break-inside properties for heading tags to 'avoid', as WebPlatform describes, to be sure the headings are placed within a single region and don't end up alone [4].
                            The region-fragment property determines how the last region behaves. If the content were to break in the last region the overflow will not be rendered because there are no other regions for the 
                            content to flow to but it would act as though it was flowing into the next region and a break would occur.

                        <h5>Nesting and Grouping</h5>
                        <p>
                            Nesting and grouping help organize and reduce CSS. As HTMLDog.com explains, if the CSS and HTML are structured well you won't need to rely on element IDs or classes to target specific elements. Instead
                            you can give an ID or class to a top level element and target the child elements like h1 or p rather than needing to target the h1 and p tags by specific names. For example
                            .parent h1 { color: red; } and .parent p { color: blue; }. This is what is referred to as nesting, the child tags are nested within their parent. Grouping allows you to target
                            different elements which all need to be styled similarly. For instance h3, .example, p { color: green; } will target header 3s, elements with the .example class, and paragraph elements
                            and set their color to green. This is shorter than targeting and styling each of those separately. [5]

                            When interacting with a website or application people expect feedback from the application to know that it's working and processing information. It's also expected that if someone navigates to a website
                            on their phone, desktop, or tablet that the site will still be functional. Using animation techniques is one way to enhance the user experience and differentiate your application
                            from competitors and media queries are essential for adjusting a website to a given screen size and resolution.

                            CSS transitions change the style of an element over a period of time. This can be helpful to illustrate to users that their actions have taken affect and the application
                            is processing. We have control over how the style changes and how long the transition takes to complete. You can chain together multiple styles
                            with time intervals by defining a list of transitions. Transitions are controlled by the following properties: transition-property, transition-duration, and transition-delay. There is 
                            also a transition-timing-function for determining "how intermediate values for properties are computed" [2]. The effects can be triggered from events such as hovering over an
                            element or by using JavaScript.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The transition-property lists the CSS properties which will change and only those listed will be affected (i.e. background-color). The transition-duration specifies how long the transition takes to complete.
                            The transition-delay specifies how long to wait before applying the transition once the trigger occurs. Finally the transition-timing-function has several possible values 
                            including: ease, ease-in, ease-out, linear, step-start, step-end, steps (which specifies how many steps to take during the transition). It's also important to consider accessibility 
                            and to allow users to turn off the animations if they so choose.

                            CSS Transformations can change the shape and position of an element. Again, this is something that can enhance the user experience at times although accessibility concerns are also something to consider.
                            Some of the transformations include skewing, scaling, and rotating an element. This includes both 2D and 3D transformations. We actually looked at these earlier within the
                            Media Controls section. MDN points out that only elements positioned by the box model can be transformed and that a good rule of thumb is to check to see if the element has display set to block [2].
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We saw the use of the transform property earlier. There is also a transform-origin property which specifies the position of the origin [2]. By default this is at the center of the element but you can 
                            set it separately if needed. This is used with rotation, skew, or scaling transforms. For 3D transforms there are other properties to consider. The property perspective changes how much depth is applied
                            to the element, effectively pulling it away from the viewer. This helps to establish the impression of the 3D effect. There is also a perspective-origin property which changes the perspective given positional 
                            values like top, left, or percentages like 50% 50% (which is centered). Below is an example from MDN [2].

                            Animation can also be achieved using CSS at-rules. One example is the @keyframes at-rule. This can be used to animate things using keyframes along a sequence [1].
                            Different styles will be applied at different points in the animation sequence and thus animate the element.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You define an @keyframes rule with the initial state and the ending state (using "from" and "to" or percentages) and name the keyframe. In the animation CSS property you then specify the 
                            @keyframe name along with other parameters such as the duration of the animation, the delay, and how many times to repeat the animation. You can also specify how 
                            many steps the animation will take to complete a cycle using the steps() method. [2]

                            Media queries are used to alter which CSS styles are applied based on screen size and device constraints. So your web page can be styled one way for desktops but differently
                            for phones for example. It also allows the UI to change dynamically if you were to resize a browser window for instance to either decrease or increase the viewport.
                            You can supply many different media queries to be sure your application works for a variety of devices. These can also be useful for adding specific styles for a particular screen size 
                            in order to fix the user experience. You can even load the style sheets based on these queries rather than placing all the different styles into a single CSS file.
                            This way you will load the correct styles from an organized file targeting a designated size with specific constraints. A style sheet will download regardless but will only apply if the media
                            query is true [2].
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            MDN explains that media queries are useful for conditionally applying styles with @media or @input rules, targeting media for the style, link, and source tag and other 
                            HTML elements with a media attribute, and for testing and monitoring media states using Window.matchMedia() and MediaQueryList.addListener() methods [2].
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Media types include all, print (printers), screen, and speech (synthesizers). This value defaults to all. Print is intended for paged material. Media types describe the general category
                            of a device [2].

                            Media features include width, height, aspect-ratio, orientation, resolution, scan, grid, update, color, among many others. These help determine what device the user
                            is viewing the media with. These are used within the query to target specific features and requirements. You can also apply logical operators. These are "and", "not", "only" and 
                            "," (comma). "And" combines media features within a query and is also used to join media features with media types. "Not" negates a media query. You must specify a media type
                            when using "not". "Only" applies the style when the entire media query matches the device and can be helpful "for preventing older browser from applying a style" [2]. When using "only"
                            you must also supply a media type. The comma "combines multiple media queries into a single rule" so it behaves like an OR operator [2].
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In practice you'll create media queries based on various conditions which will make use of the logical operators. Furthermore you'll be able to group the queries
                            with commas to create different situations where a particular style should be applied. Remember that "not" is applied last to a specific media query (meaning it won't apply to 
                            a comma separated list--only to the query it is attached to) [2]. Media queries are also evolving and have had different iterations known as levels which improve upon the syntax
                            and change features. For instance in level 4 you can use less-than and greater-than (or equal to) operators to specify ranges rather than check for a min- and max- value (i.e. 
                            @media (5em <= width <= 10em) { ... }). Below is a simple example of a media query in action. Adjust the browser size to watch the color change.

                            You can show and hide elements using one of several different CSS properties. These include display, visibility, and disabled. The display and visibility
                            properties allow you to hide an element. These work similarly however when using the visibility property to hide an element (with a value of "hidden") the document will still behave
                            as though the element is within the DOM structure. So the space it is taking up on the page is not removed. If you want to instead remove the space the element takes up
                            set the display property to "none" which will completely hide the element. If you would rather just disable the element and leave it visible on the screen the disabled
                            attribute will allow you to do that. Elements become greyed out and inaccessible but still react to mouse events. A disabled element also can't be focused on and the command event will not fire [4]. 
                            Disabled is only allowed for form controls and has no effect on other elements [4].
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Display has many possible values including block, inline, run-in, flow, flex, and grid among others. As MDN explains display sets the inner and outer display types of an element [2].
                            "The outer type sets an element's participation in flow layout; the inner type sets the layout of children" [2].
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Visibility has several values including: visible (the element is displayed), hidden (the element is not drawn but affects the layout), and collapse. Collapse is
                            useful for tables to quickly hide a column or row but won't affect spacing. If applied to flex items the item and space are removed. For other elements it is as if 
                            the element was hidden. [3]

                            In order to apply logic or styles we need to be able to locate elements within the DOM. We can do this in several ways and frameworks and libraries like jQuery can make the syntax easier to use and read.
                            This is true for CSS as well which can target elements by class or id for instance. We can also create pseudo-classes to represent different things and target and style based on those.

                            There are various types of selectors. It's possible to select elements given their tag, their id or their class (i.e. #id and .class). There are also
                            ways to select elements given their other attributes. JavaScript and jQuery provide APIs for selecting based on these same properties as we've seen throughout these notes 
                            in the Programmatically modify HTML section. You can also select all elements with the wildcard *.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Additionally there are combinators. These are:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A + B : adjacent siblings - the second element follows the first immediately and they share the same parent</li>
                            <li>A ~ B : general siblings - the second element follows the first at some point and they share the same parent</li>
                            <li>A > B : child - elements must be direct children of the parent element</li>
                            <li>A B : descendant - elements must be children of the parent element</li>
                            <li>A || B : column - elements must be within the scope of a column - this is experimental</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Of course there are also pseudo-elements and pseudo-classes which we'll see below.

                            Elements can be targeted using a selector for a specific tag. For example you can apply a style to all divs by creating a CSS selector: div { styles here }. This applies to JavaScript
                            and jQuery as well given their APIs. To be more specific you can add ids and classes to elements. These attributes are helpful for targeting 
                            specific or related groups of elements. You can also target attributes given specific values or preferences. In order to find elements by their attributes you can use the querySelector and 
                            querySelectorAll DOM API methods. jQuery also allows you to find elements by attributes with the following syntax: $("[attr=value]"). Remember that quotes must surround the value if it has a space within it [3].
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Attributes can be selected using the following patterns.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>[attr] - a specific attribute</li>
                            <li>[attr=value] - a specific attribute set with a specific value</li>
                            <li>[attr~=value] - a specific attribute with a list of words where one is the defined value</li>
                            <li>[attr|=value] - an attribute with the defined value or that value after a hyphen (this is often used to match language subcodes [2])</li>
                            <li>[attr^=value] - an attribute whose value begins with the defined value</li>
                            <li>[attr$=value] - an attribute whose value ends with the defined value</li>
                            <li>[attr*=value] - an attribute whose value contains the value specified</li>
                            <li>[attr operator value i] - the i or I causes the value to be case-insensitive</li>
                            <li>[attr operator value s] - an experimental value for case-sensitivity</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Note that ordered lists need to have the case-sensitive type modifier defined due to how HTML treats the type attribute. This has to do with the type attribute being used with the input element. [2]

                            Pseudo-elements let you style specific parts of the selected element. These are keywords that target things like the first line of an element (::first-line).
                            The list of pseudo-elements includes: ::after, ::first-line, ::selection, ::backdrop (experimental), ::grammar-error (experimental), ::slotted(), ::before, 
                            ::marker (experimental), ::spelling-error (experimental), ::cue, ::part (experimental), ::first-letter, and ::placeholder (experimental) [4]. Double colons :: are
                            used to distinguish pseudo-elements from pseudo-classes although most browsers support both single or double colons because this wasn't originally part of the 
                            W3C specification [4]. Pseudo-elements and pseudo-classes are not selectable with an API because these are not part of the DOM. You can however find the styles applied to 
                            an element with a pseudo-element or pseudo-class [5].
                        </p>
                        <p class="pseudo-element-demo">
                            This paragraph's first line is styled. This is because I've targeted it with the pseudo-element ::first-line. The first letter has also been styled using a pseudo-element.
                            Any text that overflows onto the next line will not be styled. In this example the first line is orange and the first letter is styled red specifically. Try highlighting the 
                            text within this paragraph. This turns cyan from the pseudo-element ::selection.

                            Pseudo-classes work similarly to pseudo-elements. These allow you to style an element given contextual information like if a link has been visited, if an element is disabled,
                            if a box if checked, or if the mouse is hovering over an element. Some of the pseudo-classes include: :active, :nth-last-of-type(), :host, :only-child, :hover, :default, :out-of-range,
                            :disabled, :read-only, :empty, :last-child, :first-child, :valid, and :visited. For the full list see the MDN link below.

                            How you structure CSS files is important. Depending on how you've set up your files some styles may be overridden by others defined above them in the style sheet. In some cases you want that to happen,
                            in others you don't. Styles that are inherited can actually be overridden if you need using the !important modifier. However it would be best not to rely on that property and instead target the elements
                            differently.

                        <p>
                            We've already discussed CSS selectors and pseudo-elements and pseudo-classes above. There are a number of ways to select elements. By class or id, by element tag,
                            attributes, pseudo-elements and pseudo-classes, combinators, and you can even group multiple selectors together by separating them by a comma. Then you can define
                            a style to apply to each selected element within the grouping. Styles can also be applied using inheritance.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            "Inheritance controls what happens when no value is specified for a property on an element" [4]. Some are inherited, like an em tag within a p tag. The color of the 
                            text doesn't change inside the em compared to the rest of the paragraph. However some are not inherited. Like border, so applying a border to a paragraph won't also 
                            affect an em tag inside of it (as MDN uses as an example) [4]. Also, some frameworks like Sass and less make the syntax even easier for you and compile their syntax 
                            down to CSS for you.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A selector's specificity boils down to "how many elements could this match" [3]. MDN explains how you can score specificity using a numeric table of four columns (thousands, hundreds,
                            tens, and ones). Inline styles on a page score 1000. ID selectors score 100 for each id selector contained in the overall selector. You score 1 in tens for each 
                            class, attribute, or pseudo-class in the selector. Finally you score 1 in the one's column for each element and pseudo-element in the overall selector. The universal selector, 
                            combinators, and the negation pseudo-class give no points [3].
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There are four universal property values for specifying inheritance. These are inherit, initial, unset, and revert. Inherit will set the property value to its parent's value.
                            Initial will set the value to the browser's default stylesheet, otherwise it will default to inherit. Unset resets the property to its natural state of either inherit 
                            or initial. Finally revert will set the value to the user's stylesheet. [3]
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There is an order of precedence when using selectors. Ids and classes have more specificity than elements alone for instance. Remember the styles defined last also have 
                            precedence over styles declared earlier but that directly targeting an element using its id will always take precedence over other styles. The order goes elements and 
                            pseudo-elements, classes, attributes, and pseudo-classes, and finally id selectors which have the most specificity [5].
                        </p>
                        <div class="inheritance-example">
                            <p>
                                This paragraph is styled from inheritance. Each paragraph within this div will be styled similarly.
                            </p>
                            <p class="important">
                                This paragraph has applied its own styles with the use of !important. This rule overrides any others and applies the specified style to the element. This is
                                actually considered a bad practice. As MDN explains it can be difficult to debug issues. Rules with greater specificity win out if similar important rules are 
                                applied to the same element [5]. It's best to be more specific than to use the important rule. Generally it's a good idea to only use important when overriding
                                third-party CSS.

                            Asynchronous programming is important when dealing with user interfaces. When someone selects to do something on the UI in some cases we need to make a call to the
                            server to request some information or do some processing. We can make asynchronous calls to the server and await its response. Libraries and frameworks like jQuery support 
                            these types of interactions. WebSockets are also a popular option.

                            "The WebSocket API is an advanced technology that makes it possible to open a two-way interactive communication session between the user's browser and a server" [1]. The interfaces
                            include WebSocket, CloseEvent, and MessageEvent. The WebSocket is what is used to send and receive messages. The CloseEvent is sent when the WebSocket closes and the MessageEvent
                            is sent by the WebSocket when a message is received. The CloseEvent is sent to the WebSocket's onclose attribute listener. It has three properties: code, reason, and wasClean. code
                            returns an unsigned short value indicating a specific code (such as 1000 for Normal Closure, 1011 for Internal Error, and 1013 for Try Again Later). There are many codes which are 
                            unassigned and are reserved for future use. reason returns a DOMString giving the reason the server closed based on the server and sub-protocol. wasClean determines if the connection
                            was closed cleanly or not. [5] MessageEvents are used for many things and in our case for WebSockets it's related to the onmessage property of the WebSocket interface. MessageEvents have
                            data (what was sent), origin (USVString representing the origin), lastEventId, source (MessageEventSource - WindowProxy, MessagePort, ServiceWorker), and ports (which is an array 
                            of ports associated with the channel the message is sent through) [6].
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            WebSockets themselves have several properties including: binaryType, bufferedAmount, extensions, onclose, onerror, onmessage, onopen, protocol, readyStatus, and url. Its methods are only 
                            close and send. Its events include: close, error, message, and open. These are available through the related properties as well. The constructor takes a url and any protocols. The url uses
                            the scheme wss:// but in some cases you can use ws://. [1, 2]
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            WebSockets are great for real-time applications such as chat programs. Binary and textual data can be sent over the socket to the server. [4] WebSockets have several ready states including:
                            CONNECTING - 0, OPEN - 1, CLOSING - 2, and CLOSED - 3. [4, 7]

                            that users would need to reload their email inbox to see if they received new mail. Making a web page request all of its content over and over is very inefficient and making the user 
                            reload a page over and over is not a great user experience. "By 2003, all the major browsers solved this issue by adopting the XMLHttpRequest (XHR) object, allowing browsers to 
                            communicate with the server without requiring a page reload" [3]. Ajax allows us to query the server for additional information but not necessarily the entire web page's data again--
                            just a subset that we can append to the DOM for display for example. This reduces loading times in some cases and makes the user experience more dynamic and real-time. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Ajax stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML and the XMLHttpRequest object is part of that technology [3]. As the jQuery guide explains, this new technology allowed for services like   
                            Google Maps to be built (so users could actively navigate the map and have it automatically update itself). jQuery's ajax methods abstract the work for you because different browsers
                            implement the Ajax API differently. And while XML is in the name, generally JSON or plain HTML is sent to and from the server for processing. [3] Finally Ajax is not able to load data 
                            from across domains but Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) has allowed Ajax requests to hit different domains. [3]
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The jQuery ajax method allows you to "perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request" [1]. Other methods in jQuery wrap this function (such as get and load) so you may not need to interact with it specifically. 
                            In jQuery 1.5 ajax returns a jQuery XMLHttpRequest which extends the native XMLHttpRequest object. The ajax method takes a URL for submitting a request as well a list of settings. [1] These settings "are a set of key/value
                            pairs that configure the Ajax request" [1]. You can also default these using ajaxSetup(). Some of the options include: accepts (the type of response it will accept), async (which 
                            allows you to specify if the call needs to be synchronous), contentType (the type of data being sent to the server which defaults to application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8), data (the data being sent to the server),
                            dataType (the expect data type returned from the server), error (which specifies the function to call when an error occurs), and success (which specifies the function to call when the 
                            request succeeds). [1]

                            jQuery has event methods that can register custom methods to execute as users interact with a web page. Some of the native behaviors that jQuery wraps are .click(), .focus(), .blur(),
                            and .change() [2]. These are shorthand for the .on method as the official guide points out. Events only get attached to elements that exist when the listener is established. Newly created
                            elements appended to the DOM after the fact are not affected [2]. The on and off methods register and remove event handlers from elements. You can bind several events at the same time by 
                            using on and spacing the event names out. You can set up events to act when a user hovers over an element (and other types of events). For example you could change the background color of an 
                            element and then add a callback as a parameter to reset the background color when the user moves away from the element. You can see this in the example below.

                            jQuery allows you to typically add callbacks to methods once the first method completes. Generally these will be anonymous functions. These are aptly named because they are not named functions. You can 
                            add these in many places to achieve some sort of functionality or in event handling as in the example above. These can be passed in as parameters to other function as well. Pass the entire 
                            anonymous function as a parameter and then inside the consuming method's body call the function by using the parameter name with parenthesis and semicolon and pass in any required parameters.

                            In jQuery event handlers 'this' refers to the DOM object that called the event [1]. For jQuery in general $(this) refers to the matched elements of a query. For example 
                            you could select all the divs on a page with $('div') and then for each of them perform some operation. Within the each method you can use $(this) to refer to the specific
                            div being acted upon in the loop.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            MDN also explains that in JavaScript this can refer to various things given the context that we're in. Different contexts include the global context, functions, the bind method,
                            arrow functions, use within an object, use within a constructor, DOM events, and inline events. [2]

                            Web Workers are a way to create threads in the browser. As MDN explains these won't interfere with the UI and these can even perform input and output operations [1].
                            Workers run code contained within a JS file in a new thread. These are run in a separate global context than the current window so they can't affect the DOM [1]. 
                            "Using the window shortcut to get the current global scope (instead of self) within a Worker will return an error" [1]. Some workers can be shared across multiple 
                            files whereas others are only accessible from the script which first ran it. These are known as Shared or Dedicated workers. These use the SharedWorkerGlobalScope 
                            and the DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope respectively.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Some of the restrictions of Web Workers include not being able to manipulate the DOM and you can't use some of the methods and properties on the window object. MDN notes 
                            some of the things that are accessible include WebSockets and data storage mechanisms like IndexedDB and the Data Store API [1]. In order to communicate between a Worker and 
                            the main thread the postMessage method is used in either case. The onmessage event handler allows you to gather the Message object for use which contains the data being sent. [1]
                            Finally workers can do network requests with XMLHttpRequest but as MDN notes again the responseXML and channel attributes will always be null. [1] They also have access to 
                            the navigator and location (read-only) objects as well as the application cache. [3]

                            MDN demonstrates a simple Web Worker example which multiplies two numbers together [1]. Following that example this page sends and receives a simple string message (view the console for output). 
                            In order to start a Web Worker it's important to check that the Worker interface is available for use by wrapping your code in the follow if statement: if(window.Worker) [1].
                            This helps with error handling and backwards compatibility. Next newing up a worker is simple: const webWorker = new Worker('script.js'); Workers communicate with the main thread
                            using the postMessage and onmessage event handler. To stop a worker we simply need to terminate it: webWorker.terminate(); You can also have the worker stop itself by calling self.close(); [2]

                           Data can be passed back and forth from the main thread to Web Workers using the postMessage method as has already been discussed. The onmessage and onerror event handlers will trigger
                           when receiving a message or when an error has occurred. The onerror method implements the ErrorEvent interface and the handler has three key fields: message, filename, and lineno. These are the 
                           error message, the file in which the error occurred, and the line number where the error occurred. [1, 2]
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When creating a Shared Worker (one which multiple files have access to) you communicate with it using a port number. This is done explicitly in the case of Shared Workers and implicitly in the case
                            of Dedicated Workers. You can set up the port using the start method. If two-way communication is going to be required the worker and the main thread must call it. The onmessage method can also 
                            be used to set up the port implicitly. In either case this must be done before communication can proceed. [1] For Shared Workers the onconnect handler is set up to fire when a connection is made.
                            From there the port can be pull out of the event object and the onmessage handler can be set up on that port to listen for incoming messages. [1]

                           The setTimeout and setInterval methods can be used to run Web Workers. setTimeout runs once after a set amount of time. setInterval runs repeatedly given the set amount of time. This can 
                           be useful to process some sort of queued user input for instance or running a spell checker. [2, 3]

                           We saw the two Web Worker event listeners: onmessage and onerror. onmessage is called when a message is received from either the main thread to a Web Worker or vice versa. You can then act upon
                           the message received. If an error occurs the onerror method will be called and errors can be logged and handled there. onconnect is used with Shared Workers in order to set up communication 
                           between a Shared Worker and a file. Then the port (which is accessed through the event object) can be configured with the onmessage handler to listen for incoming messages. [1]

                           The postMessage method only accepts a string value and it cannot be a function [2]. However this string value can of course be a serialized JSON object or XML which can contain
                           lots of useful information. Web Workers don't have events for when they are started and stopped and you can only stop them with worker.terminate or self.stop. Finally workers are contained
                           within their own global context and thus have no access to the DOM from the original page. [2] The messages passed from one thread to the other are copied and not the original reference
                           from the thread. This can take a lot of time to copy if the payload is large. HTML5 Rocks mentions that you can use Tranferable Objects to quickly copy data from one context to another [3].
                           Web Workers also don't have access to window, document, or parent [3].

                            Validating user input is an important thing to remember to do. Otherwise malicious users can inject scripts into your site that affect it and your other users. This can potentially
                            lead to putting everyone at risk of losing account information or opening people up to other attacks. Locking down input to specific values rather than allowing freeform text is one
                            way to help prevent issues. Past this being sure to escape freeform text and other fields is important so that user input will be interpreted as a string and won't be able to 
                            execute as code. These are just some of the things to consider.

                            Regular expressions are useful for pattern matching. These can also get out of hand easily so having good tests and comments describing what they represent can be helpful. Regular expressions (or regex as it's known) is 
                            found in many programming languages and can even be applied to input HTML elements. You could use regex to validate email addresses for example. We did this already above in the "HTML5 Input Types and Attributes" section.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            MDN's article below describes Regex in JavaScript. They explain that you can construct a regex object in one of two ways. First is by using forward slashes to enclose the pattern (i.e. /ab+c/). The other is by using the 
                            RegExp constructor method and passing the pattern as a string value (i.e. new RegExp('ab+c')). [1] The forward slash constructor represents a regex literal and is good to use when the regex is a constant value [1].
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You can use patterns to match against string values to determine if the given string conforms to a particular pattern. Sometimes you are looking for simple substrings like strings that contain a particular set of characters. 
                            For example /cat/ would match strings like "cat", "catastrophe", and the like but would not match "ca t". Regex has many special characters that can enhance the pattern matching capabilities.
                            You can use them to find strings that contain more than one instance of a particular character or that start and end with a particular pattern. MDN lists all of the characters in their guide [1].
