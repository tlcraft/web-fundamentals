                        <p>
                            Semantics refers to the meaning of something. When using HTML one should think about the information within the template and the organization of that information rather than 
                            its appearance. Once the data is organized it can later be styled using CSS for presentation purposes. The semantics of a web page are important to programmatically traverse the 
                            data. Web browsers use this data and so do other agents such as smart phones and other programs. HTML is the data structure for the web page which is separate from the graphical 
                            aspects we interact with as users.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Along with the idea of separation between data and presentation is that HTML elements need to be used to represent the data appropriately. This is to help ensure that web 
                            browsers and other agents navigate and access the HTML correctly. For example if an agent wanted to display the title of the page it would look within the HEAD element for a 
                            child TITLE tag. This consistence is something we need to be able to rely upon and is why it is also so important to remember.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                            Optimizing a web page to increase its search index on search engines, such as Google and Bing, is important in grabbing a consumer's eye. Not often is it that someone reviews 
                            several pages of search result to find what they're looking for. Algorithms are very good at locating what it is exactly that person is looking for and it usually appears toward 
                            the top of the results. Plus there are more widgets now which provide greater functionality to the user upfront (such as when searching for airline tickets for example) users 
                            don't have to look very far to find what they need.
                        </p>

                            In order to be relevant a web page must take into consideration "SEO" techniques to increase their chances of being ranked higher and found. This includes using the correct HTML 
                            elements and attributes (such as title and alt), having relevant words and content, as well as how many other web pages link back to yours which is important as a search engine's 
                            "crawler" investigates websites and links across the internet.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If a website has the same content in more than one location it will help to use the rel=canonical attribute so search engines can redirect users to the page you would rather them 
                            see. This helps search engines organize the ranks appropriately and increases the SEO. Another technique similar to this is a 301 redirect. 301 is the status code for content that 
                            has moved permanently to another URL. Other codes include 302 which is either for "moved" or "found" content. In HTTP version 1.0 it meant "moved temporarily" but in version 1.1 it's 
                            been updated to mean "found". 307 became the replacement for "moved temporarily" in version 1.1. Meta Refresh is another redirect which is generally used with countdown times and 
                            "click here" links if the redirect doesn't occur. However it's not recommended for SEO and is slower.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Link equity is another ranking factor which refers to links passing "value and authority" from one page to another. If a very valuable site links to another site then the search 
                            engine can presume the content on the linked site is valuable as well. Links need to be relevant to the original content, crawlable (via the robots.txt file), located in prominent 
                            places (e.g. within the main content as opposed to a footer), and use the appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g. 200 and 301). These factors play into a links value and equity.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The robots.txt file is the first file a crawler will parse once it reaches a website. This file can tell the crawler which pages to skip which can be important so internal pages 
                            (those of which a user interacts with once logged into the site) are not crawled and indexed. Google has even commented that internal search results pages are considered spam so these 
                            should be excluded in this way.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Schema Markup is another aspect of SEO. It's a "semantic vocabulary of tags (or microdata) that you can add to your HTML to improve the way search engines read and represent your 
                            pages" in search results according to Moz.com. Moz.com continues by describing the differences between Schema, microdata, and structured data:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Structured data is a system of pairing a name with a value that helps search engines categorize and index your content. Microdata is one form of structured data that works 
                                    with HTML5. Schema.org is a project that provides a particular set of agreed-upon definitions for microdata tags.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Schema can be used to enhance the search results descriptions with content such as reviews, organizational information, and information about a person or book for example. 
                            The major search engines use this data to enhance the results page but it's unclear if using the markup actually helps with search ranking but appears to increase the website's 
                            click-through rate as users are more apt to click a link with a more descriptive result.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            HTML defines the semantics of a web page, and Schema helps to give context to the data. For example a header tag with the text "avatar" may refer to a movie, an image, or some 
                            other content. Using Schema helps better define the content which helps search engines determine how to display the data in search results.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The official Schema.org documentation explains that "microdata is a set of tags introduced in HTML5" which allow us to markup HTML with this additional data.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Schema Example</h5>
                        <p>
                            Some of the important tags to remember are: itemscope, itemtype, and itemprop. These can be added to HTML elements to signify different things. itemscope should be applied to 
                            the wrapping HTML element for a given group of information. The itemtype is used to describe what that group of information is, for example a movie. itemprop is used to more 
                            fully define other information about the item, for example an author's name and a genre. Below is a concrete example of apply Schema to a div describing a book.
                        </p>
                        <pre>
        &lt;div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Book">
            &lt;h1 itemprop="name">Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software&lt;/h1>
            &lt;span>Written by:&lt;span itemprop="author">Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, John Vlissides&lt;/span>&lt;/span>
            &lt;span itemprop="genre">Software Engineering&lt;/span>
        &lt;/div>
                        </pre>
                        <p>The most generic type is "thing" which has the following properties:</p>
                        <table>

                        <p>
                            Using semantic HTML is very important when considering accessibility and screen readers. The browser and accessibility tools will key off of the semantic HTML to help someone 
                            navigate your website. Using the wrong element to accomplish something, such as using a div element to create a button, can be confusing to people and other agents.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Using the correct ARIA and semantic HTML is also helpful in navigating a page because users can quickly navigate between links, forms, headings, paragraphs, sections and other 
                            elements. Along with that being descriptive within an opening sentence in a new paragraph for instance helps users skip content they aren't interested in much like someone would 
                            who can visually review the content.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Screen readers convert text to speech to help people navigate and understand a website. These users may have disabilities ranging from visual impairment to cognitive disabilities. 
                            Being sure to define the language the website is presented in is very important. This can be done within the html tag by defining a lang attribute. It's also possible to wrap smaller 
                            sections of text in the span element and apply the lang attribute to the span (though lang can be applied to many other elements as well).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The proper use of headings is helpful as well because search engines use these to index a web page's structure and content. People are drawn to the headlines which direct them to 
                            different sections of relevant content.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Alternative text is important to have on images. This helps give context to the page when a screen reader encounters an image. Screen readers will read the text in the alt attribute 
                            for the user so be sure the text is descriptive. It's also useful to users when an image link is broken because the alt text will display for them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Finally it is important that links are spelled out and descriptive to the user. "Click here" means nothing but links such as "book airline tickets here" helps to put things into 
                            perspective. Remember we can add title attributes to elements such as the anchor tag. Doing so is helpful because the information can be displayed as a tooltip to the user when 
                            mousing over the link.
                        </p>

                            It's important to remember that content described through a screen reader is much line an automated telephone directory. The content is "linearized" to the listener so, while some 
                            users can quickly navigate a web page visually, those users who utilize a screen reader must do so by listening to each option before understanding what actions are available. 
                            Consider this when designing your web pages.

                        <p>
                            Utilizing a layout for your website is important to help guide users to your content. Often content is displayed similarly to how magazines and newspapers layout their content. 
                            There are main headings and footers for consistency and navigation. Important information is placed between these sections in relevant ways. It's also important that navigation is 
                            easy between different sections of your website. Several new HTML5 elements help with creating layouts. These are: header, nav, section, article, aside, details, summary, and footer.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There are several different techniques for creating a layout. These range from basic tables, floats, a flexbox, modern frameworks, and grid views. Tables are generally not 
                            recommended because they weren't even designed to be a layout tool [1]. Other options provide more modern and flexible alternatives which is important when considering mobile 
                            devices and varying screen size and resolution.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This page itself uses several of the aforementioned elements including section, article, and nav. Each topic on this page is defined as an article. These are wrapped 
                            in a section element. I'm also using a nav element for navigation to the right of the content in the scrolling sidebar among a few other locations.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Frameworks</h5>
                        <p>
                            There are several popular CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap and Foundation. These frameworks supply their own set of HTML and CSS element for you to use in consistent and reliable 
                            ways. Both of the mentioned frameworks are modern and mobile friendly and take out a lot of the work in setting up device agnostic websites.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Floats</h5>
                        <p>
                            The float property can help build layouts as well and it's quite possible you will run across this property when dealing with styling at some point or another. It can be confusing 
                            so spending some time reviewing it could be helpful. Ultimately the property "floats" the content of an element to the left or right and is commonly used to wrap text around images [2].
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The clear property specifies what elements can float beside the cleared element and on which side [2]. It has several properties: none, left, right, both, and inherit. You generally 
                            want to clear the same direction as the content is being floated. If you float content to the right, then you should clear the content to the right. This would mean that no floating 
                            elements are allowed on the right side of the element [2]. Sometimes content is too large for an element so a clearfix must be applied. If there is overflow the containing element will 
                            expand to enclose the large content. The code samples below are examples of two ways to create a clearfix as described by W3 Schools [2].
                        </p>
                        <pre>
        .clearfix {
            overflow: auto;
        }

        .clearfix::after {
            content: "";
            clear: both;
            display: table;
        }
                        </pre>
                        <h5>Flexbox</h5>
                        <p>
                            The CSS Flexbox is a new layout mode available in CSS3. It's only supported in more modern browsers with no support in IE10 and earlier [1]. The flexbox helps ensure that elements 
                            "behave predictably when the page layout must accommodate different screen sizes and different display devices" [1]. The flexbox allows content within a container to "flex" into a 
                            dynamic size. The container is able to alter the height and width of its items to fill the available space [3]. It is also direction-agnostic where block is vertically-based and inline 
                            is horizontally-based [3].
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The flexbox has several parts because it encompasses the whole widget rather than a single item. There is the parent container known as the "flex container" and the elements within 
                            that container known as "flex items" [3]. The following examples color the containing element brown and the child items as light-yellow and each apply characteristics of the flexbox 
                            differently.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Flex Container Row. This wraps and is justified to the end.</h5>
                        <div class="flex-container-row flex-container">

                            All of the above examples use CSS properties of the container element. The following uses properties of the items themselves. It's possible to change the order of the items by defining 
                            an ordering index using the order property. You can see an example of this in the next sample.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Flex Item Order. Order was used to arrange these items.</h5>
                        <div class="flex-order flex-container">
                            <div class="flex-order-item-last flex-item">
                                This is defined first, but is ordered last.
                            </div>
                            <div class="flex-order-item-first flex-item">
                                This is defined second, but is ordered first.
                            </div>
                            <div class="flex-order-item-second flex-item">
                                This is defined last, but is ordered second.
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            flex-grow and flex-shrink are used to expand or reduce the size of an item if necessary. These are proportional numbers so if an item has a flex-grow value of 2 and the other items 
                            have 1 the item set to 2 would take up about half the size of the container [3].
                        </p>
                        <h5>Flex Item Grow and Shrink. Proportions were used to size the items.</h5>

                            flex-basis is used to "set the default size of an element before the remaining space is distributed" [3]. flex is a combination of flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis. 
                            CSS-Tricks.com recommends using this shorthand version because it knows how to intelligently set the properties. The default is 0 1 auto [3].

                        <h5>Flex. flex defines the grow, shrink, and basis of these items.</h5>

                            Finally it's possible for items to align themselves. The align-self property allows an element to be aligned using the same values as the container align-items property 
                            (e.g. flex-start, flex-end, stretch, and center).

                        <p>
                            The CSS Grid allows a designer to organize content is a grid-based layout using rows and columns. Frameworks such as Bootstrap and Foundation have their own implementations which 
                            help make modern web pages responsive. Generally a grid is broken into twelve columns and CSS styles are generated to size content based on those columns. For example one could define 
                            CSS classes for content which may span between one and all twelve columns. Each of these would be given a width proportionate to its size. This can be taken further to add style based 
                            on small, medium, and large screen sizes (which you will find the frameworks support).

                            Understanding the Document Object Model is important when building a website. Modern frameworks like Angular and React manipulate the DOM for you to make creating user interfaces easier. 
                            The DOM (as it's known) is what connects web pages to scripts and programming languages [1]. "The DOM represents a document with a logical tree" [1]. This tree can be traversed 
                            and updated using JavaScript and libraries such as jQuery as well as with the DOM interface.
                        </p>

                            In the following sections we'll explore manipulating the DOM and adding or modifying HTML. We'll also see use of different media controls and learn more about the HTML5 Canvas and Scaled Vector Graphics (SVGs).

                            Understanding the fundamentals of manipulating the DOM is important. It's what modern frameworks and libraries are built upon. Aidan Ryan has a good overview of this particular section of the exam on his blog. 
                            To quote him, "The document object is a node that represents the entire HTML document (including the head). Everything in the DOM is a node. It's important to differentiate between nodes and elements: all 
                            elements are nodes, but not all nodes are elements. For example, a div element may have an id attribute - the attribute is a node, but not an element [2]."
                        </p>
                        <div class="modify-dom-examples">
                            <div>
                                Here are some examples of the DOM API:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Grab a single element by ID: <pre>document.getElementById('elementId')</pre></li>
                                    <li>Gather a list of elements by the tag name: <pre>document.getElementsByTagName('div')</pre></li>
                                    <li>Gather an array of elements by name: <pre>document.getElementsByName('name')</pre></li>
                                    <li>Gather an array of elements by CSS class: <pre>document.getElementsByClassName('class')</pre></li>
                                </ul>
                            </div>
                            <div>
                                Here are the equivalent examples using jQuery:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Grab a single element by ID: <pre>$('#elementId')</pre></li>
                                    <li>Gather a list of elements by the tag name: <pre>$('div')</pre></li>
                                    <li>Gather an array of elements by name: <pre>$('[name="name"]')</pre></li>
                                    <li>Gather an array of elements by CSS class: <pre>$('.class') </pre></li>
                                </ul>

                                This paragraph is contained within a div. Below demonstrates the use of the above methods on this particular div and its containing children.

                            The Node class is "an interface from which a number of DOM API object types inherit" [3]. Those being: Document, Element, Attr, CharacterData (which Text, Comment, 
                            and CDATASection all inherit from), ProcessingInstruction, DocumentFragment, DocumentType, Notation, Entity, EntityReference [3]. Because these all inherit from the 
                            same Node interface they are able to be treated the same way.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Some of the notable properties include:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Node.nodeType: returns an unsigned short representing the type of the node (e.g. ELEMENT_NODE: 1, ATTRIBUTE_NODE: 2, TEXT_NODE: 3, ENTITY_NODE: 6, DOCUMENT_NODE: 9, DOCUMENT_TYPE_NODE: 10).</li>
                                <li>Node.nodeName: returns a DOMString containing the name of the Node. Differs depending on the node type. For example HTMLElement will contain the name of the corresponding tag, like 'audio', for an HTMLAudioElement, or Text will return a '#text' string.</li>
                                <li>Node.nodeValue: returns or sets the value of the current node.</li>
                                <li>Node.parentNode: returns a Node that is the parent of the current node. Returns null if no parent is available (e.g. if the parent is not an Element).</li>
                                <li>Node.previousSibling: returns a Node representing the previous node in the tree, null if there isn't a node available.</li>
                                <li>Node.nextSibling: returns a Node representing the next node in the tree, null if there isn't a node available.</li>
                            </ul>
                            The jQuery equivalents to firstChild, lastChild, nextSibling, and previousSibling are below:
                            <ul>
                                <li><pre>var element = $('#container');</pre></li>
                                <li><pre>element.children(':first');</pre></li>
                                <li><pre>element.children(':last')</pre></li>
                                <li><pre>element.next();</pre></li>
                                <li><pre>element.prev();;</pre></li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Elements can have attributes which provide additional information about them. They are set like name="value" pairs within the starting tag. Some examples of attributes 
                            include: src, alt, title, rel, width, height, style, lang, id, class, for, name, onresize. There are many more and you can view a list on the W3 School.com website following 
                            this <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_attributes.asp" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Goes to the attribute list on W3Schools.com">link</a> [4].
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Attributes are not considered children of a node [2]. We can access them using the DOM API like so (there is no jQuery equivalent but you can build your own):
    <pre>
        var div = document.getElementById('divId');
        var attributes = div.attributes;
    </pre>
                            Attributes can be updated, removed, and accessed using either jQuery or the DOM API as Aidan Ryan demonstrates on his blog [2]:
    <pre>
        var div = document.getElementById('divId');
        var val = div.attributes['id'].value;
        val = div.getAttribute('id');
        var valNode = div.getAttributeNode('id');
        div.attributes['id'].value = 'newValue';
        div.setAttribute('id', 'newValue');
        
        var jqDiv = $('#divId');
        var jqVal = jqDiv.attr('id');
        jqdiv.attr('id', 'newValue');

        var hasId = element.hasAttribute('id');
        var jqHasId = (element.attr('id') !== undefined);

        element.removeAttribute('id');
        element.removeAttributeNode(element.getAttributeNode('id'));
        jqElement.removeAttr('id');
    </pre>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The next step after being able to access a DOM node it be make changes to it or the overall structure of the page itself. 
                        </p>
                        <div id="ui-controls-mod-practice" class="ui-controls-practice">
                            <div class="controls">
                                <label for="ui-controls-new-text">New Text: </label>
                                <input type="text" id="ui-controls-new-text" name="ui-controls-new-text" placeholder="Enter some text!" />
                                <button type="button" onClick="setNewText()">Change last parapgraph text</button>
                                <button type="button" onClick="addNewParagraph()">Add a new paragraph of text</button>
                                <button type="button" onClick="removeFirstParagraph()">Remove the first paragraph of text</button>
                                <button type="button" onClick="replaceAllParagraphs()">Replace each paragraph with an image</button>
                            </div>
                            <p>This paragraph's text will be replaced with whatever you enter. Just click the button to see the text change.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Finally, as Aidan Ryan concludes on his blog, for both the DOM API and jQuery an element can only exist in one place in the DOM. So to move a node using these techniques
                        removes it from its old position and places it in the new one. jQuery provides the following methods which target a particular node and pass the new content as a parameter:
                        after, before, append, prepend, replaceWith, wrap, wrapInner, wrapAll. The following related methods in jQuery target the new content and pass the targeted selector in as 
                        a parameter: insertAfter, insertBefore, appendTo, prependTo, replaceAll. Lastly remove targets just the specific content to be removed from the DOM.
                    </p>

                            People consume a lot of media from the web and over the years there have been different advances allowing people to do just that. As MDN explains, in the early days of
                            the web video files were too large to be consumed given bandwidth and other technological limitations [3]. As the web grew extensions like Flash provided a way to consume
                            media and quickly became popular. These extensions have issues with security among other things but now with HTML5 and current browsers we can utilize the video and audio 
                            tags to provide media playback natively within the browser. We can also utilize services like YouTube for the hosting and streaming of content.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Audio</h5>
                        <p>
                            Both the video and audio tag support the following attributes [1]:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>src: the URL for the audio or video content</li>
                            <li>autoplay: a boolean determining if the content should play automatically or not</li>
                            <li>loop: a boolean for replaying the content automatically or not</li>
                            <li>controls: a boolean telling the browser to show media controls for the content</li>
                            <li>preload: how much data should be preloaded before the content can begin (none, metadata only, or automatic amount determined by the browser)</li>
                            <li>muted: a boolean specifying if the content should be muted or not</li>
                            <li>type: a string indicating the MIME (multipurpose internet mail extension) type for the content</li>
                            <li>crossorigin: an attribute to determine if the Origin header should be sent along with the request to gather the content or not</li>

                        <p>
                            The audio element supports three audio file types: MP3, WAV, and OGG. You can provide multiple source files for the different file types as well as a fallback message if 
                            the user's browser doesn't support the audio tag (for example IE 8 and below). Here is an example of an audio element (Music: www.bensound.com):
                        </p>
                        <audio controls="controls" preload="auto">
                            <source src="https://www.bensound.org/bensound-music/bensound-summer.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">

                        <h5>Video</h5>
                        <p>
                            The video tag supports the above attributes as well as a poster attribute. This would be a URL to an image to display while the video loads [1]. Several other attributes include:
                            buffered for adding time ranges for the buffered media and playsinline for playing the media back within the element's playback area (though not including this doesn't mean the 
                            content would default to fullscreen) [4]. Like the audio tag, the video tag also supports fallback content in the form of a paragraph. When providing fallback content you can 
                            explain to the user that the tag is not supported by their browser. You could also link them to the content on another site or provide more description of the content.

                        <p>
                            The ability to provide fallback sources is important because different browsers may only support certain file types (which is true for older browser versions). As the years go by 
                            more and more standards are supported but providing fallbacks is always a good practice. Some attributes need to be supplied for different browsers to play the media correctly.
                            For example the MIME type must be provided for audio media to play correctly in Firefox.

                            There are a number of events that are related to media playback. These include [1][4]:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>canplay: The browser can play the media but possibly not through its entirety (canplaythrough estimates the browser won't have to buffer the media).</li>
                            <li>playing: Playback is ready after being paused or stopped due to lack of data.</li>
                            <li>ended: Playback has stopped because the end of the media has been reached.</li>
                            <li>timeupdate: The currentTime attribute has been updated.</li>
                            <li>play: Playback has started.</li>

                        <h5>Graphics</h5>
                        <p>
                            Scalable Vector Graphics and the Canvas element are two different ways to add graphics and animation to a website. SVGs are scalable so the resolution doesn't degrade as an image scales. 
                            SVGs are great for icons that need to scale based on device size and screen resolution. The canvas is strictly programmable using JavaScript and is great for things like games 
                            and animations. Using the canvas you can draw shapes and animate them. You also have access to WebGL which is a powerful tool for creating 3D and 2D objects.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Each of these tools has pros and cans so use each depending on your need. Ben Sinca lists several key differences between the two. Canvas is resolution dependent, 
                            has no support for event handlers, has poor text rendering capabilities, can be saved as an image (png or jpg), and is well suited for graphical  games [3]. He writes that
                            SVGs are resolution independent, support event handlers, are best suited for apps with large rendering areas, slow rendering can be complex, and that they are not 
                            suited for games [3]. As Aidan Ryan describes it in his blog post, canvas is more of a "fire and forget" or "immediate" model of rendering whereas SVGs have a 
                            "retained mode" which allows us to change and re-render the graphics [1].
                        </p>
                        <h5>Canvas</h5>
                        <p>
                            Canvas allows us to draw lines, rectangles, curves and other elements. The origin is in the upper left with the x axis along the top and the y axis
                            being vertical. Positive values along the x axis move to the right, and for the y axis move down the screen. In order to interact with the canvas you must
                            get the context in which you intend to draw with, for example 3D or 2D. This context is what you interact with and call methods on in order to draw. 
                            The context has style attributes which can be set to change colors and gradients and methods for drawing lines and shapes like boxes and curves. 
                            Below is an example of a canvas with multiple different examples from text to shapes and lines.
                        </p>
                        <canvas id="example-canvas" class="example-canvas" width="400" height="200"></canvas>
                        <h5>Scalable Vector Graphics - SVGs</h5>
                        <p>
                            SVGs are great for graphics and icons when you need to consider resolution and screen sizes of multiple devices. Font Awesome is a website which provides a large set 
                            of vector icons that can be freely used on websites. They also have an SVG Framework that utilizes SVGs which is a great example of all of this in action. SVGs can be 
                            modified with CSS as well as their own attributes [1]. They can even be modified using the DOM API and pseudo-classes can trigger changes too [1]. Below is a 
                            simple example of an SVG using the Codewars.com logo. There are also a couple of examples of different shapes below that.

                            Updating your website user interface programmatically as a user interacts with it is an important part of creating an engaging experience. Dynamic websites
                            can provide a much more rich experience for the user. It may be the difference in attracting and keeping people on your site for longer periods of time.
                            That can be important if you are building a website which intends to captivate an audience and engage them long-term. Updating the UI based on user selections,
                            or from reacting to different events, is certainly a nice touch but in the current age of media is more or less expected.
