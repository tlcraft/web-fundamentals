# HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Review

In order to prepare for certifications and to review the various aspects of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript I'm creating an overview of the fundamentals of each language.

The focus will be on covering the topics outlined on the  Microsoft HTML, CSS, and JS exam which you can review by following this link: [Microsoft HTML, CSS, and JS exam](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/exam-70-480.aspx).
