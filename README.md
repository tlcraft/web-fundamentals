# HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Review

In order to prepare for certifications and to review the various aspects of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript I'm creating an overview of the fundamentals of each language.

I'll work through the content on these pages and implement things myself to better practice, review, and learn:

* [HTML 5.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/)
* [CSS3](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS3)
* [ECMAScript 262](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm)
* [MDN JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
