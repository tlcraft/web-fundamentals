# HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Review

In order to prepare for certifications and to review the various aspects of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript I'm creating an overview of the fundamentals of each language.

I'll work through some of the content on the following tutorials and references and implement things myself to better practice, review, and learn:

* [MDN HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
* [MDN CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
* [MDN JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)

* [HTML 5.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/)
* [Understanding CSS Specifications](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/read.en.html)
* [CSS3](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS3)
* [ECMAScript 262](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm)

* [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/)

The focus will be on covering the topics outlined on the [Microsoft HTML, CSS, and JS exam](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/exam-70-480.aspx).
